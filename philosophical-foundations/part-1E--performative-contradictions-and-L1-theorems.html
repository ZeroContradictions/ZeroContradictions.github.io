<li>Existence: I do not exist.</li>
<li>Consciousness: I am not conscious.</li>
<li>Aliveness: I am dead / I am not alive.</li>
<li>Epistemic Free Will: I cannot choose anything. / I will not to will.</li>
<li>The Truth Exists: All statements are false.</li>
<li>Objective Truth Exists: There is no objective truth.</li>
<li>Invalidity of Skepticism/Solipsism: One cannot be certain of anything; one can only be certain that one exists.</li>
<li>Validity of Reason: Reason is not a valid source of knowledge.</li>
<li>It Is Good To Have Values: People should not have values / Having values in of itself is a bad thing / A world with no value would be preferable (more valuable) over a world with value generated by sentient beings.</li>
<li>Philosophical questions <b>do</b> have objectively true answers: Philosophical questions do not have objectively true answers.</li>
<li>Communication is Possible: Communication is impossible.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Invalidity of Existential Nihilism: Existential Nihilism is true.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Another corollary of the theorem that it is good to have values (besides the partial debunking of Efilist philosophy) is that moral nihilism must be false, because it would follow from the theorem that it would also be good foe people to have moralities based on their values. (After all, why would an individual who is a product of evolution not want to pursue their own self-interests?)</li>
<li>But if it is simultaneously the case that morality is perspective-dependent and that that individuals should satisfy their own interests, this implies that either: selfish individuals should seek to fulfill their own interests at the costs of others (competition) or more preferably that individuals should cooperate with each other for greater maximal gains (the more preferable choice in this disjunctive conclusion).</li>
</ul></li>

<li>There is no objective truth.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>QUESTION: But can this really be a true performative contradiction if it is actually the case that truth is relative and propositions can only be relatively true?</li>
<li>QUESTION: Is it possible to prove that truth is relative or objective?</li>
</ul></li>

<li>There is no objective knowledge.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What is the difference between truth and knowledge?</li>
</ul></li>

<li>There is no objective morality. -There HAS TO be an error here in why this is NOT a valid performative contradiction.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The reason why this one does not work is because morality is intrinsically perspective dependent. Even if the person saying this statement might believe in objective morality, there can only be objective morality from their perspective at most, based on whatever values the believer has.</li>
<li>More generally, this shows that performative contradiction does not work if the thing in question is perspective-dependent.</li>
<li>Another reason why this statement does not prove objective morality is because claiming the non-existence of objective morality does not have to implicitly assume the existence of objective morality. Stating that &ldquo;nothing is objectively immoral&rdquo; is merely the statement of an objective fact.</li>
<li>It can be more clearly shown why there is no contradiction in this statement if we rephrase the statement with two other statements that have exact equivalent meaning:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is no objective morality. = Nothing is objectively immoral. = All morality is relative.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Belief in nihilism is incompatible with nihilism. Those who put forth an argument in favor of nihilism are committing a performative contradiction: the action of arguing presumes the contradiction of the argument.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Foundationalism is Necessary for Rational Philosophy: A foundationalist theory of epistemology is not necessary in order to make conclusions about philosophy.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If this statement is asserted without evidence, then it essentially constitutes an axiom for the epistemological theory of the person making the claim, thus leading to a foundationalist theory of epistemology (even if the person making the statement won&rsquo;t admit that they&rsquo;re still relying upon foundationalism).</li>
<li>If this statement is made as the conclusion of some line of reasoning, that reasoning will have to be based on some set of premises, or other conclusions that are also proven by even earlier premises and assumptions. Thus, a foundationalist theory is necessary to make the statement itself, the statement is revealed to be contradictory, and the inverse statement must be concluded by Reductio Ad Absurdum. A foundationalist theory is therefore necessary in order to have a sound philosophy of any kind.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&ldquo;It is not allowed for some person I to require some other person II to follow person I&rsquo;s morality.</li>
<li>CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: How would this foundationlist epistemic theory resolve the Liar&rsquo;s Paradox? (&ldquo;This statement is false&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Although the Liar Paradox naturally comes up when trying to think of all the possible performative contradictions, we don&rsquo;t believe it offers any insight into the construction of our foundationalist framework. There are several proposed solutions to the moral paradox, but I currently think I like Arthur Prior&rsquo;s resolution the best. However, I am predicting that my favored solution for the Liar Paradox will probably change as I learn more about logic and its nature.</li>
<li>Although it is indeed a performative contradiction for a person who is arguing to argue that they are not arguing about anything, this contradiction does not contribute anything to our philosophical understanding of metaphysics and epistemology, so we won&rsquo;t use it for our framework.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT: Explain the metaphysical versions of the classical logic axioms, in addition to the propositional ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Performative Contradiction: &ldquo;If you are gatekeeping about issue Y, then you are not a member of ideology X (e.g. Libertarian/Anarchist/Voluntaryist/Efilist/Antinatalist/Objectivist/Muslim/Christian/Ethnic<sub>Group</sub>/Conservative/Feminist/etc).&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Note: This is a performative contradiction because it is gatekeeping against people who gatekeep (for other reasons). It makes sense that this is a performative contradiction because depending on the definitions for who counts as a follower of a particular ideology, not following issue Y could deem said people as non-members of ideology X. This reasoning is also likely related to the No-True-Scotsman Fallacy.
</p>

<p>
Performative Contradiction: Communication is impossible.
</p>

<p>
Performative Contradiction: Constantly interrupting the other person in a performatively contradictive effort to argue that the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma doesn&rsquo;t exist.
</p>

<p>
An example of an obvious refutation of Argumentation Ethics is when a defendant or criminal essentially has a gun pointed to their head and they are forced to rationally argue to be released.

<h2 id="orgd4bfa19"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Thinking Some More About Additional Performative Contradictions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In his book The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics (which he co-wrote with physicist David Harriman), Peikoff argues that there is no problem of induction, because philosophy is itself an inductive science and, therefore, that any attempt to deny the validity of induction contradicts itself by implicitly accepting the validity of induction. Peikoff and Harriman also argue that scientific claims verified by induction should be considered true until new evidence warrants modifying or amending them because scientific knowledge derived from induction is contextual.
</p>

<p>
In other words, those who on the basis of conclusive evidence make inductive scientific claims regarding science cannot argue that their claims are subject to no possible modification, but can argue that they are the only rational claims that can be believed based on the available evidence. They conclude that the same process of induction is essential to every rational field (except mathematics) and that, as a result, truth in any such field possesses the same objectivity as that of physics.
</p>

<p>
It is a performative contradiction to &ldquo;know <b>that</b> you don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. It is NOT a contradiction to &ldquo;know <b>what</b> you don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Blocking a phone number still means that the other end CAN receive your messages, just not your calls. And if you block them, you can&rsquo;t receive read receipts, so you wouldn&rsquo;t know whether they received their receipts or not. This can create the false illusion that you can&rsquo;t send any messages to the blocked person. You can send the messages, you just can&rsquo;t know if they received them or not.

<h2 id="org4ad5e68"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Why It Is A Performative Contradiction To Believe That People Can Have Free Will Independent Of Their Materialistic Minds</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Given that we live in a deterministic universe and we obviously already know what it&rsquo;s like to live in one, what would a non-deterministic universe be like to live in?</li>
<li>By definition, this would mean that life would have free will that is not bound to how its DNA or brains are programmed.</li>
<li>Free will only concerns life. In our materialistic universe, life is matter that was created with the perfect mix of chemicals to be able to do all its functions and behave the way it does.</li>
<li>In other words, in an idealist universe, it would be possible to create something that behaves just as life does in our universe, but is able to also not behave as life does in our universe.</li>
<li>Such a concept would probably be deserving of a different word other than &ldquo;life&rdquo;. Perhaps it could be &ldquo;frilife&rdquo; (meaning free-will life).</li>
<li>The minds of frilife would be able to act independently of how they are materialistically structured. No matter what structure frilife has, it would be acting independently according to how some supernatural force desires.</li>
<li>The structure of the minds of frilife would therefore be completely useless and irrelevant (aside from sending signals throughout the body necessary to maintain basic life-sustaining processes like temperature regulation, pain, senses, et cetera).</li>
<li>But there&rsquo;s a problem. If frilife was acting independently to how its mind is structured, what else would it be controlled by to decide how it should behave and function? Another materialistic structure? No, because the premises rule that out as impossible. And there is no other known force in the universe that could make it act independently of its structure. In conclusion (according to everything we currently know obviously), frilife is impossible because it creates a metaphysical contradiction.</li>
<li>By trying to imagine such as a concept, the text above collectively forms a Proof by Contradiction. Though it was unintentional to write a proof, this is a very interesting proof.</li>
<li>Likewise, this is why religious people are able to believe that free will exists. They make the mistake of imagining a supernatural power that would make it the case that the contradiction above never exists, thus free will would be able to exist. But the reality is that this is not the case because they assumed a false premise in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And what would such a universe be like from a physical-materialistic perspective?
    i
</p>

<p>
And what would an idealist (mind-oriented) monistic universe be like to live in?
    i
</p>

<p>
Person 1: I deny the existence of consciousness. it is simply an illusion arising from the sum of related brain activities, because we evolved in a way to make that useful. if it never existed in the first place, can it go anywhere?
</p>

<p>
Person 2: It’s the only thing we can be sure isn’t an illusion.. brains are doing something unique, most definitely.
</p>

<p>
Person 1: If you are basing this on Descartes&rsquo;s Cogito ergo sum, I have bad news. &ldquo;I think therefore I am&rdquo; is circular reasoning, because it immediately assumes the existence of self, thing that it is tryign to prove. It assumes there is an &ldquo;I&rdquo; to do any sort of action that is &ldquo;thinking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Person 1: Some I have seen liken consciousness to a user illusion. Basically, just think about what consciousness even is, and where it comes from. If it is reducible to the action of particles on an individual level, where does the whole come from? The truth is the whole isn&rsquo;t real and it is a very finely crafted and powerful illusion
</p>

<p>
Person 1: Edit: by &ldquo;where does the whole come from,&rdquo; I mean that things only &rsquo;exist&rsquo; in wholes from your own perception of them. In reality there are no wholes. This is where the illusion part comes in: that a sum of wholes is fundamentally different from its parts.
</p>

<p>
Person 2: Define Illusion. Descarte&rsquo;s argument is thus more precisely described as: If I am thinking, then I exist. I am thinking. By modus ponens, I exist.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Concepts, language, and systems of classification are all created by the mind to form its understanding and interpretation of reality, but they are not reality itself.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
This should be a better argument than Descarte&rsquo;s argument since it doesn&rsquo;t assume what it&rsquo;s trying to prove:  Some conscious being came existence and saw something in a mirror. The consciousness believes that the picture in the mirror exists because it can observe it. It identified the picture in the mirror as itself. It thus concludes that itself must exist because it has the mental capacity for self-awareness, and it is made aware of itself through direct observation and identification. The consciousness then correctly identifies itself as the person writing this text, and the person who is writing this text correctly identifies itself as the consciousness described within this text (both actions are the exact same thing). I thus conclude that I exist.

<p>
What is the difference between assuming what you&rsquo;re trying to prove (name of this fallacy?), and using proof by contradiction to prove that a given fact is true?
</p>

<p>
I believe that the most scientific and truthful explanation is that consciousness is not a thing or an entity, but an action the brain does. No brain, no action.
    This is the only thing that makes sense, and is the only thing the evidence supports. There is not a single reliable case study showing that consciousness is independent from the brain, which is what would be required for it to survive brain death.

<h2 id="org1456d6c"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> The Ultimate Justification For Sense Perception</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The ultimate justification for sense perception is similar to the justification for reason. Reason is the only thing that we have, so if we reject reason, then we have nothing. Likewise, if we reject empiricism and insist that we cannot trust our senses to the extent that they are not impaired or illusioned, then we don&rsquo;t have any way of receiving any other sort of input from reality.
</p>

<p>
So we don&rsquo;t exactly have a foundation for proving empiricism and sense perception (to the extent that it is valid). We have a brain, and we have senses. And we must choose to use both of them because that&rsquo;s all we have.
</p>

<p>
The necessary justification of sense perception will be important to note after establishing the L1 Theorems and defining the reasoning process, perhaps when in the subsection header titled Sense Perception.
</p>

<p>
It should be self-evident to anybody who rejects the existence of supernatural phenomena that sense perception is the only source of input that humans have for observing and learning about reality.
</p>

<p>
The acceptance of reason, sense perception, and that reproduction is the ultimate biological value can each be justified not only evolutionary theory, but also on the grounds that if they are not accepted, then there’s not really any other alternatives (although there are millions of alternatives to valuing reproduction, it’s still the most reasonable one from a biological standpoint and also because it aligns well with psychological intuitions).
</p>

<p>
NOTE: The basis for cooperation ethics for greater prosperity might ultimately be justified somewhat objectively per se by the same reasoning that is used to ultimately justify the validity of senses, validity of reasoning, and procreation as the ultimate purpose of life.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, evolutionary reasoning can also justify empiricism, just as it can justify reason, which helps build coherency.

</p>

<p>
Although it would go without saying to a rational mind that was raised in a secular environment that supernatural phenomena don’t exist, we cannot assume that the audience was raised secularly (in fact, most people are statistically more likely to have been raised in a religious environment), hence why it will be necessary to debunk all supernatural after explaining the reasoning process and the criteria and nature of degrees of certainty/skepticism and why arbitrary statements are not epistemically valid.
