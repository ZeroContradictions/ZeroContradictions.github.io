<h2 id="flaws-of-libertarianism"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> List Of My Disagreements With Libertarianism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-flaws-of-libertarianism">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Georgism is necessary for truly free markets, to protect negative rights, to significantly reduce wealth inequality, to prevent real estate bubbles, and conserve the Earth&rsquo;s finite natural resources.</li>
<li>Freedom is not the most important value. Preserving the stability and prosperity of modern civilization is the actual most important value.</li>
<li>The Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">is incompatible with human nature</a>, although it is notable for being a good first attempt at trying to establish the rules of a cooperative society.</li>
<li>It is misleading that Libertarians try to conceptualize the NAP as a standard for objective morality. In order for this to be the case, there would have to be an objective definition of what does and does not count as &ldquo;aggression&rdquo;. But since &ldquo;aggression&rdquo; is subjective, the NAP is also subjective. That also means that there are at least dozens or hundreds of different conceptions of the NAP, instead of just one.</li>
<li>Eminent Domain can be justified in favor of society&rsquo;s collective interests in the right situations, especially if a land-possessor fails to pay their Location Value Tax.</li>
<li>Peak resources is a real concern. It is horribly mistaken to believe that humans will never run out of resources when they live on a planet with a finite amount of material resources. Natural Resources Taxation is the most logical solution.</li>
<li>Eugenic Population Control (EPC) is necessary in order to preserve modern civilization in a world where the traditional constraints on evolution have disappeared due to modern technology.</li>
<li>Regulations to prevent overpopulation are a good thing since the Earth has finite resources, Demographic Transition Theory is completely wrong, and this is everybody&rsquo;s best interests to prevent war, disease, and famine in the future.</li>
<li>Immigration controls are a good idea.</li>
<li>Morality is <i>not</i> objective because morality necessarily has to depend on perspective. Moreover, it is also very dangerous to view morality as completely black and white.</li>
<li>Open-carry is not a good idea for the same reason why public nudity is not a good idea. It disturbs the peace, and it&rsquo;s not advantageous anyway since concealed-carry is superior from a game-theoretic perspective.</li>
<li>Libertarians frequently tend to be ignorant/naive of geopolitical realities. For example, Reason Magazine had both the ignorance and the nerve to blame NATO (a defensive alliance where all members join with democratic support) for Russian aggression, despite a history of Russians invading their neighbors and a well-known Russian interest to restore the USSR.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://reason.com/2022/02/28/ukraine-putin-war-russia-nato-us-bad-europe-clinton/">https://reason.com/2022/02/28/ukraine-putin-war-russia-nato-us-bad-europe-clinton/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reason.com/2022/10/28/it-should-be-ok-to-talk-about-negotiating-with-russia-over-ukraine/">https://reason.com/2022/10/28/it-should-be-ok-to-talk-about-negotiating-with-russia-over-ukraine/</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The world should have already learned from 1939 that appeasement is <i>not</i> an option for ending war. If Ukraine brokered a deal to let Russia keep its annexed territories, Russia would simply attack Ukraine again and again in the future until they finally take over the entire country. And then Russia would accomplish the rest of their outdated geopolitical desires and worldview.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>i</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Military spending is not a waste if it secures rational national security interests.</li>
<li>Government is necessary in order to establish, guarantee, and protect a free market.</li>
<li>A parliamentary democracy with other characteristics that deter corruption, tragedies of the commons, and other failures is actually a reasonably good way to determine the laws of a society since morality is subjective. However, it must also be emphasized that this assumes a public of rational voters. The promotion of eugenics works well with this.</li>
<li>Global government is a good idea since it is necessary in order to prevent Tragedies of the Commons from happening on a global scale. The humanist ideology of the United Nations is a terrible basis for a global government, but if a rational ideology that understands evolution well was the hypothetical global government&rsquo;s ideology instead, then the arguments against global government aren&rsquo;t really any better than the standard arguments given against any form of government.</li>
<li>Tariffs, power projection, and other foreign policy tools can actually be useful and rational for securing national interests and playing good geopolitics.</li>
<li>Genetics and culture, genes and memes go hand in hand. If government is necessary in order to produce more favorable outcomes when a failure in the interaction of genes and culture arises, then so be it. Example: setting a maximum hour workweek in South Korea.</li>
<li>Pigouvian pollution taxes are one of the best solutions to regulating pollution, reducing climate change, and reducing society&rsquo;s current dependence on inefficient roads and cars.</li>
<li>Government is necessary for doing urban planning right. Urban planning is very important because it affects future societal and economical outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although Libertarians portray humans as being indoctrinated by the government to support the government, they&rsquo;re just merely using the <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-rhetoric-of-exploitation_21.html">Rhetoric of Exploitation</a>. It is not a good argument to portray culture as indoctrination because culture and context are always inseparable from human life.
</p>

<p>
Instead of calling the relationship between a citizen and the government a &ldquo;social contract&rdquo;, it should instead be called an <b>Implicit Mutual Social Agreement (IMSA)</b>. Every time the word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; is used, Libertarians and Ancaps complain that it&rsquo;s not really a contract because they never signed it. And while they&rsquo;re right about that, they&rsquo;re missing the point. The idea is that if you want the benefits that society gives you, then you have to comply with society&rsquo;s rules, even if you don&rsquo;t like all the rules. You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too. If you&rsquo;re going to break the IMSA, then society is justified to prosecute you.

<div id="outline-container-NAP" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="NAP"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why It Is Misleading To Think Of The Libertarian NAP As A Single Principle</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-NAP">
<p>
Although the Libertarian NAP is defined as an ethical rule prohibiting all actions that violate negative rights, there is disagreement among Libertarians regarding what should and should not count as negative rights. Libertarians might be inclined to believe that it&rsquo;s obvious as to what counts as a negative right since it can be asked as a yes/no question, but it&rsquo;s actually not that simple because there are lots of gray areas. And even if you try to resolve the gray areas by definitively drawing a line in the sand, this is not going to work for everybody. Some people are going to disagree with the ultimate decision, whether that&rsquo;s a small minority, or whether the disagreement is split half and half among the population. For example, two Libertarians might say that they both believe in the NAP, but if you dig deeper and ask more specific questions, they actually disagree on a number of things (abortion, IP rights, rainwater rights, etc). When I used to be a Libertarian, this I used to believe this (that it is obvious regarding what does and does not count as negative rights) until I started asking deeper questions about ethics (e.g. Georgism) and became a moral relativist.

<li>What Counts As Deception?</li>
<li>Et Cetera. This isn&rsquo;t even a complete list of all the ways how Libertarians might disagree with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The bottom line here is it&rsquo;s not sufficient to define a legal code only according to the NAP, because there&rsquo;s simply way too much variation in what people would consider to be &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-aggression&rdquo;. A legal code would have to be much more specific and rigid because people will disagree on what counts as negative rights and then some. With all that being said, it&rsquo;s more accurate to think of the Libertarian NAP is a spectrum of NAPs that tends to favor negative rights, depending on what people should and should not count as negative rights. Assuming that we want to achieve a stable, high-technological society with little to no violence and abundant resources, Libertarianism is not the way forward.

<p>
In a way, this world already has exactly what Ancaps are asking for. There are hundreds to thousands of different jurisdictions and sub-jurisdictions that you could move to if you don&rsquo;t like the laws that come with living where you are <i>now</i>. With so many options for &ldquo;opting-out&rdquo; available to you, how could <i>anyone</i> reasonably argue that it&rsquo;s not possible for you to opt-out of the laws that you live under today? I don&rsquo;t see how Ancapistan would be any different. If Ancaps can&rsquo;t even be satisfied with migrating to a different jurisdiction with different laws when there are at least hundreds to choose from, this suggests that Propertarianism and the freedom to migrate somewhere else (or opt-out as you say) won&rsquo;t be sufficient for resolving every human&rsquo;s moral disagreements with one another.
</p>

<p>
Of course, Ancaps are assuming that all, most, or some of them would each do their best to conform with their own versions of the NAP, but it&rsquo;s not clear how you could even guarantee that each Ancap-citadel would try to follow the NAP in the first place, especially since Ancaps can&rsquo;t agree with each other on what counts as a violation of the NAP, much less since an Ancap society has never existed (and never will).
</p>

<p>
However, since people cannot universally agree on what does or does not count on aggression, I would argue that in a way, this world already has exactly what Ancaps are asking for. If you disagree with the Canadian version of the NAP, then you can migrate to the United States and live under the American version of the NAP instead. If you still don&rsquo;t like that, then you can also choose to opt-out for the Mexican NAP, the Japanese NAP, the Australian NAP, the German NAP, the Mongolian NAP, the Nigerian NAP, the Swiss NAP, and so forth. If you just do some researching, you can probably find a legal jurisdiction that has a decent interpretation of the NAP that you&rsquo;re looking for. Aggression is subjective, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that there are multiple NAPs, one for every jurisdiction.

There is a conflict between Alloidal-Voluntaryists&rsquo; support for the Libertarian NAP and their support for Propertarianism. Although we already live in a Propertarian world (considering that different countries have different laws for enforcing their different ethical views), Voluntaryists and Libertarians are still unhappy with this because the Voluntaryist / Libertarian spectrum of NAPs is not enforced to a sufficient extent of their liking.

Why should someone agree to some ancap&rsquo;s legal system when they could shop around for another that fits their own moral preferences instead?

Now I never believed in Argumentation Ethics myself, but a lot of Ancaps do, and this essay does a great job at debunking it: <a href="http://www.justopia.org/exploding-argumentation-ethics.html">http://www.justopia.org/exploding-argumentation-ethics.html</a>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-libertarian-tech-ignorance">
<p>
In this section, I write my response to some naive quotes that have been written by ancaps who don&rsquo;t realize that technology is a double-edged sword.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ancaps: &ldquo;Tax evasion is one of the main uses for bitcoin.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You wanna know what else are great uses for bitcoin and crypto? Scams, ransom, hacking attempts, human trafficking, et cetera. By making transactions anonymous, yes there are some good people who gain freedom from the government, but what you&rsquo;re overlooking is that there are always at least two sides to every moral action. When transactions become anonymous and untraceable, you also make it easier for criminals and evil-doers to get away with their bad deeds and immoral acts. And as more and more companies, individuals, and governments become more accepting of cryptocurrencies, they are also becoming more accepting of these criminals&rsquo; nefarious and untraceable means of collecting money. And you support that apparently. Crypto does have some advantages, but your perspective on cryptocurrencies is very one-sided.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Ancaps: &ldquo;This is huge. Future generations will chuckle at your short-sightedness and small mindedness for doubting the power of crypto-currency. You sound like the nay-sayers when the Internet was in its nascency.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yeah, sure. The Internet totally hasn&rsquo;t had any negative effects on society whatsoever. You&rsquo;re being one-sided again. With the Internet also came the Dark Web, a popular hub for criminal activities. The Internet is also causing ideological extremists like Ancaps to congregate together, and the rise of these radical ideologies is a contributing factor to the fall of people&rsquo;s faith in the current democratic society and the rising instability of our culture and society. Social media may not be worth the costs that it has had on society. And of course, the Internet is responsible for the spread of lots of fake news and misinformation all over the world. In many ways, human societies would be better off if the Internet was never invented.
</p>

<p>
Why should we expect the growing popularity and adoption of cryptocurrencies to be any different? Cryptocurrencies might do some good for society, but they will also undoubtedly cause some predictable harm as well. Stuff like this becomes more obvious when you reject the concept of a Universal Good or a Universal Evil, and it&rsquo;s just one of many reasons why it&rsquo;s so illogical to believe in an Objective Morality, or &ldquo;universally preferable behavior&rdquo; as you call it. There is no such thing because every cause and every action has both an upside <i>and</i> a downside. It just depends on the perspective you&rsquo;re viewing the cause/action from.

I have so many more things that I want to add to this file. I&rsquo;ve spent years being a Libertarian myself, and I&rsquo;ve spent almost as many years arguing with them too, so I have a lot more to say and write.
