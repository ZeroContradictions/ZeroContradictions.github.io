<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
<b>Malthusianism</b> is defined as the theory that potentially exponential population growth can surpass the linear growth of an environment&rsquo;s carrying capacity (including its food supply and other resources), which eventually causes members of the population to die off until settling back down to the carrying capacity.
</p>

<p>
<b>Neo-Malthusianism</b> is defined as the theory and concern that overpopulation (and overconsumption) may increase resource depletion and/or environmental degradation and lead to ecological collapse or other hazards. Neo-Malthusianism is often coupled with advocacy of human population planning to ensure sufficient resources for current and future human populations as well as for other species.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cornucopianism</b> is defined as the theory that overpopulation, overconsumption, and environmental problems faced by society either do not exist or can be solved by technology and/or the free market.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The simplest way to disprove Cornucopianism is to point out that it is absurd to insist that there can be infinite population growth within a finite environment.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, just because we haven&rsquo;t faced overpopulation yet, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will never happen. Everything that was thought impossible, but was possible, only seemed impossible until it actually happened. Even though Thomas Malthus&rsquo;s predictions on the world&rsquo;s maximum population have been proven wrong so far ever since the Industrial Revolution began, that doesn&rsquo;t make Cornucopians right because it&rsquo;s equivalent to saying &ldquo;Well I haven&rsquo;t died yet, so I will never die&rdquo;, even though that is absurd. Everybody knows that life cannot live forever, and likewise, everyone ought to know that infinite growth is impossible within a finite environment.

Contrary to the most widely reported predictions out there, the world population will NOT peak at 11 or 12 billion people, because the reasoning used to make this conclusion relies on false assumptions about biology, evolution, and fertility.

Inmendham has repeatedly advocated in favor of it many times, but he is completely wrong that educating the rest of the world will lead to a long-term decline in global fertility rates, as it could only be a temporary decline at most.
</p>

<p>
The religious fundamentalists and other people with the highest fertility rates will out-compete the rest of the entire world, and the genes and memes that caused child-free people to choose not to have children will die out. The end result is that the genes that caused higher fertility rates will become more populous, and this will cause the world population to skyrocket once more until it crashes against the carrying capacity ceiling. The world population will <b>not</b> max out at 11-12 billion people, and if it does, that will only be because the world population reached the carrying capacity of the Earth.

<p>
What most people don&rsquo;t realize about overpopulation is that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s possible for it to happen both instantly and unpredictably if a major catastrophe happens, just like the Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849). Once the potato was introduced to Ireland, the country had a population explosion since the crop increased the number of available calories and nutrition to the population.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Nobody would&rsquo;ve predicted in 1843 or 1844 that the island would be infected with a blight within the next year that would cause a massive famine where a million people die and another million have to emigrate. One year, the island was not overpopulated because it had enough resources for everybody. The next year, it was facing famine and mass exodus. That&rsquo;s how quickly overpopulation could potentially happen, if the catastrophe causing it is severe enough.
</p>

<p>
The key to causing overpopulation to have a new staple crop or technology that causes a population boom, followed by some event which disables the stimuli / resources that were responsible for the population boom. Although the population growth leading up to an overpopulation event might happen gradually, the catastrophe that leads to the overpopulation can happen instantly and unpredictably. All it takes is a major and/or unprecendented catastrophe, and everything changes. Since it&rsquo;s always possible for an unpredictable colossal catastrophe to cause instant overpopulation, that means that ideally we should <b>always</b> be prepared against a potential overpopulation crisis.

<h2 id="orgffdbcf1"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> False Predictions About Imagining The World If The Black Plague Had Never Happened</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
I once had a history teacher who estimated that that the current population of Europe would be 10 times greater if the Black Plague never happened, but this uses fallacious reasoning. There&rsquo;s no way that could ever happen anyway since that would require increasing the carrying capacity of Europe by ten-fold as a result of the black plague never happening.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the Black Plague did reduce the European population by about a third, but since biological populations are selected to reproduce up to the carrying capacity, it&rsquo;s more likely that the black plague only temporarily widened the gap between the current population and its maximum carrying capacity. Since there were temporarily more resources per capita available to all the living humans due to the massive decline in population, this means that the surviving humans were likely able to have more children than previous generations. Thus, the European population would&rsquo;ve returned to the carrying capacity irregardless of whether the plague ever happened.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-next-overpop-crisis" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="next-overpop-crisis"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Humanity&rsquo;s Next Overpopulation Crisis</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-next-overpop-crisis">
<p>
The next major overpopulation crisis will probably happen when a catastrophic event causes the carrying capacity to suddenly and unexpectedly shrink, rather than the population surpassing a stagnant carrying capacity. If this happens, it&rsquo;ll probably less likely to be caused by a blight or disease in the food supply since modern agricultural techniques probably use more genetically diverse crops, but we still cannot underestimate the potential for such massive catastrophes. Instead, the next major event that could cause a worldwide overpopulation crisis is more likely to be a massive war (which restricts the food supply for much of the world via embargoes, blockades, destruction of food production).
</p>

<p>
The people of today who are not concerned with overpopulation and ridicule Malthus for being wrong (so far) tend to believe that overpopulation would look like the Earth&rsquo;s population and the Earth&rsquo;s resources both increasing (the latter due to technological advancements), with Earth&rsquo;s population increasing faster. Not only does this ignore the possibility that a major/unprecendented catastrophe could cause overpopulation to happen instantly, but it&rsquo;s also less likely than the catastrophe-caused scenario since a severe catastrophe could happen at any moment.
</p>

<p>
All it will take to prove that Neo-Malthusianism concerns are/were warranted is for an unprecendented emergency to happen. For example, suppose the following series of plausible geopolitical events occurs:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>China invades Taiwan,</li>
<li>The US military defends Taiwan,</li>
<li>India takes the opportunity to attack China and seize Tibet while China is distracted,</li>
<li>Japan and South Korea support Taiwan&rsquo;s defense as well in order to protect their international trading routes through the Strait of Taiwan,</li>
<li>North Korea might takes the opportunity to attack South Korea while they are distracted,</li>
<li>Every country around the world picks a side (China vs the US),</li>
<li>WWIII starts,</li>
<li>massive food shortages begin everywhere due to the disruption of free trade, and</li>
<li>the world faces unprecedented overpopulation due to all of the aforementioned.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is a very realistic scenario, especially amid the recent rapid growth of the Chinese military and increasing Chinese aggression around Taiwan. The Russian invasion of Ukraine shouldn&rsquo;t leave the world doubting that China could follow suit and invade Taiwan whenever it chooses. If this or a similarly catastrophic scenario occurs, Neo-Malthusianism will be proven right <b>eventually</b>. Once again, History shows that overpopulation can happen unpredictably within mere months, so anyone would be incredibly naive to think that it&rsquo;s never something to worry about.
