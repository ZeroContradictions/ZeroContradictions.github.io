<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
Anarcho-Capitalism would replace government and political parties with morally-righteous political corporations that would fight each other constantly over power and morally superiority, thus combining market failures and tribal warfare with democracy&rsquo;s worst problems. Conflicts and disagreements would ultimately be justified by might makes right.
</p>

<p>
In my time within the Anarcho-Capitalist / Voluntaryist Community, I realized that Ancaps are not as cohesive a social group as most outsiders would tend to believe.

<h2 id="rothbardian-vs-private-cities"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Defining Rothbardian Anarcho-Capitalism Versus Private Cities Anarcho-Capitalism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-rothbardian-vs-private-cities">
<p>
<b>Rothbardian Anarcho-Capitalism</b> (RAC): Anarcho-Capitalism as it was first conceived by Murray Rothbard. Under RAC, multiple political corporations can have overlapping authority on the same plot of territory.
</p>

<p>
<b>Private Cities Anarcho-Capitalism</b> (PCAC): Anarcho-Capitalism, except that only <i>one</i> political corporation can have control over a plot of territory. Different communities that favor different laws, legal codes, customs, and such would each form their own private city where their ideals are exclusively enforced.
</p>

<p>
When I went through my Ancap phase, I started off as a Rothbardian Anarcho-Capitalist, but then I became a Private Cities Anarcho-Capitalist as I found it harder and harder to reconcile the problems with Rothbardian Anarcho-Capitalism, until I eventually rejected Anarcho-Capitalism altogether. Most people don&rsquo;t make a distinction between these two types of Anarcho-Capitalism, but I argue that this is an important distinction to make because I&rsquo;ve found some Private City Anarcho-Capitalists don&rsquo;t like RAC, and understandably so, because PCAC has far fewer problems than RAC and is more likely to be successful, hence why I converted from the former to the latter near the end of my Ancap phase.

<h2 id="rothbardian-AC"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Thoughts On Rothbardian Anarcho-Capitalism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-rothbardian-AC">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ancaps assume that the defense agencies are going to enforce the NAP, but what if they never do? As it currently stands, the vast majority of people have no desire for libertarian ethics, and without consumers interested in enforcing a NAP, corporations who prioritize enforcing such ethics would not make enough money to stay in business against their competitors.</li>
<li>So popular support for libertarianism is clearly a pre-requisite in order for anarcho-capitalism to work anything at all like how ancaps want it to work. In which case, they would be better off trying to garner support for libertarianism instead of proposing that the government be replaced by defense agencies.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if such a system replaced the United States government today with the beliefs that everybody has now (as an example of a world where there is <i>not</i> popular support for libertarianism), there would easily be a defense corporation that would work like a christian theocracy, one for vegans, one for extreme-environmentalists, one for moderate republicans, one for moderate democrats, maybe a centrist one for people who don&rsquo;t care, and maybe one that would pander to socialists/marxists/leftists/etc. Instead of people voting for political parties to enforce their beliefs and way of living on other people, consumers would pay &ldquo;defense&rdquo; corporations to do the same thing. There would be all sorts of different corporations that people would pay money towards to enforce their way of living on other people. [and everything could be even worse outside the United States in more religiously, ethnically, linguistically diverse populations]
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It would probably be vulnerable to mimicking a two-party system, just like our current democracy.</li>
<li>It is true that there would be a diversity of corporations to cater to a multitude of different interests, but just as the two main parties do everything they can to weaken the smaller parties today, and just as mega corporations lobby the government to make it harder for small businesses to compete against them, it is reasonable to infer that the most dominant political corporations would do the same thing to the smaller corporations. If they&rsquo;re writing the laws, they could easily write a law outlawing smaller corporations. They could then become very powerful and dictatorial since they would have the greatest capacity of any entity to inflict violence and retribution.</li>
<li>But how would the socialists/marxists/leftists/etc be able to force rich people to pay for their expensive shitty programs if there is not government with a monopoly on violence?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Presumably the richest people would form their own defense agencies, perhaps even pre-emptively to counter the socialists. In which the socialists wouldn&rsquo;t be able to force them to pay for anything. That said, would it be the case that the rich people&rsquo;s defense agencies would dominate and enslave everybody just like how all leftists predict they would? -Why wouldn&rsquo;t they be able to do this?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Libertarians already know that if corporations can lobby and influence the government to do them favors, they will because there is a profit to be made. So why would they trust corporations to replace the government? If you think it through as I have done above, this would all be a disaster unless the corporations already accept libertarianism and <i>want</i> to enforce it. They usually refute that most consumers wouldn&rsquo;t pay corrupt corporations, but again, this assumes that the consumers follow libertarian ethics, and they wouldn&rsquo;t unless libertarianism achieved majority popularity.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="anti-democracy-args-are-also-anti-AC-args"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> The Same Arguments Made Against Democracy Also Apply Against Anarcho-Capitalism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-anti-democracy-args-are-also-anti-AC-args">
<p>
All the political data analytics, manipulative political advertising, and laborious campaign events should be mentioned as counter-arguments. An ancap agency would be <i>very</i> foolish to not use these tactics. The largest, most profitable corporations would obviously use the most intrusive data analytics (demographics, job occupations, interests, passions, what people buy, etc). They would collect as much information on everybody as they possibly can to figure out what makes everybody tick, and they would use that data to manipulate everybody into joining their tribe, and they would try to conquer the world. For more information, see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUSZfEBTwRc">The Selfish Ledger - Google</a>.
</p>

<p>
Instead of calling them &ldquo;defense agencies&rdquo;, &ldquo;ancap corporations&rdquo;, etc., a better name for them would be &ldquo;political corporations&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s what exactly they are. They are corporations that profit off of enforcing their arbitrary definition of the Law, and they seek to manipulate everybody into paying them and obeying <i>their</i> laws. If a majority of people don&rsquo;t support libertarianism, then this would quickly become a very dystopian society.
</p>

<p>
So, it&rsquo;s clear to see that the most successful and most popular defensive agencies of an Ancap society wouldn&rsquo;t be chosen whichever one protects individual rights the best, but rather by whichever ones are the most successful at manipulating the masses. This is no different from how Democracies don&rsquo;t necessarily elect leaders that are the best for society, but rather they elect the leaders who are the best at manipulating people into voting for them. The way how the consumers would pay the political corporations that they like the best is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_voting">Dollar Voting</a>, which is hardly any different from how a traditional democracy works.

<h2 id="summary-of-rothbardian-AC-problems"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Summary Of Problems With Rothbardian Anarcho-Capitalism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-summary-of-rothbardian-AC-problems">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>It requires at least majority support for Libertarianism as a prerequisite.</li>
<li>And even if general support for Libertarianism was achieved, there&rsquo;s still many issues that libertarians could easily disagree on, including but not limited to: abortion, death penalty, immigration, open-carry, intellectual property, black mailing, legal penalties, pollution, georgism, how parents should be able to raise their children, etc.</li>
<li>Anarcho-Capitalism would replace political parties with political corporations. Instead of people voting for the party or candidate that they support the most to enforce their beliefs on other people, people would be paying corporations to do the exact same thing. It would be bring us back where we started, maybe even farther back.</li>
<li>Instead of resolving ethical disagreements by choosing majority rule, disagreements would be resolved according to which corporations have the most consumers and the most money. If disagreements are resolved by economic means, then the laws would be largely determined by what&rsquo;s economical for corporations, which is largely determined by the beliefs of their consumers since the consumers pay money to the corporations that enforce their beliefs the best. <b>Just as ethics should <i>not</i> be determined by majority rule, ethics should <i>not</i> be determined by the economics surrounding popular opinion. The best legal system would use reason to resolve ethical disagreements, not majority approval or the economics of popular opinion.</b></li>
<li>The Rothbardian model of anarcho-capitalism would bring back all of democracy&rsquo;s worst problems. People would be tribalistic about the corporation they support, political corporations would create divisive and manipulative propaganda to win support (similar to the political rhetoric and ads featured in western democracies), etc, and worst of all: the laws would not enforce the NAP (due to bullet #3).</li>
<li>The corporations would be interested in collective massive profits AND political power, not just profit alone. Collecting massive profits would lead to gaining more political power, and gaining more political power would lead to increased profits. The synergy from this combination would make it easier than ever for monopolies to form.</li>
<li>The political data analytics, manipulative political advertising, and laborious campaign events done by today&rsquo;s political campaigns, parties, and organizations would be amplified with even greater intensity due to bullet #5. The largest, most profitable political corporations would collect the most intrusive data analytics (demographics, job occupations, interests, passions, social bubbles, what people buy, etc) to figure out how they could manipulate everybody into joining their tribe, and it would foolish for any corporation to not do this. Does anybody really want to live in a world where corporations have even greater incentive to collect such information and brainwash people?</li>
<li>Anarcho-capitalism does not support georgism, even though there are no good rebuttals against georgism. Without land value tax, there would be massive inequality and economic inefficiency, which would contribute to the dystopian nightmare.</li>
</ol>
<p>
All of the bullet points above (except for bullet #8) could be resolved by creating private cities that people can join and leave.
