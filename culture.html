            Hello and welcome to my philosophy blog. My name is ZeroContradictions, and on this home page you will find links to my philosophical writings <font color="red">(highlighted in red)</font>, as well as links to posts from blogs written by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy <font color="blue">(highlighted in blue)</font>, and links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <font color="green">(highlighted in green)</font>. As per its name, the goal of this blog is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that. The Modern World has reached an unprecedented level of insanity due to immense evolutionary mismatch, and it is now more important than ever to get the philosophical grounding necessary for solving the problems set before us.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: As of November 2022, the vast majority of the red link posts written by myself are unfinished, and have sections that need further elaboration and/or updating with my current beliefs, but I'm publishing what I have already written for now for others to read if they'd like. If you have any constructive criticism on this blog's HTML/CSS design (it's my first time designing a website), please reach out to me at <a class="my-essays" href="meta/contact-page.html">my contact page</a>. I will probably have to learn how to write some PHP code in order to optimize this blog's design.

    <li><a class="my-essays" href="culture/objective-morality-nonsense.html">Post-Moralism: Why Objective Morality is Absolute Nonsense</a>
        <p>Post-moralism is the philosophical position that game theory is the best way to understand morality. It is similar to moral relativism since it posits that morality can only be perspective-dependent, but it's different since it also embraces the game-theoretic assumptions of selfishness and rationality.</p></li>

        <p>Not believing in objective morals is similar to not believing in God, the rejection of an imaginary ontology that doesn't exist.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-lion-king-moral-narrative.html?view=classic">The Lion King Formula for Moral Narratives</a>
        <p>Most moral narratives revolve around Us Vs Them and Good Vs Evil, used by people for justification of their ideologies since the narratives fit their social instincts and worldview conditioned by the media. They are similar to the Walt Disney movies like the Lion King.</p></li>

        <p>Blithering Genius explains how morality is made up of collective values, individual internalization of said values, folk theory, and individual and collective moral myths and assumptions. "Objective Morality" is debunked as an oxymoron.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/01/altruistic-morality-and-victimhood.html?view=classic">Altruistic Morality and Victimhood</a>

        <p>Everyone thinks inside a box, created by heuristics that our brains use to limit the complexity of thought; Why greater rationality correlates with greater individualism and free speech.</p></li>

    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/09/freedom-of-speech.html?view=classic">Freedom of Speech and Why It is Important</a>
        <p>Freedom of speech exists to talk about controversial ideas from outside the Overton Window. This it is necessary for the best ideas to flourish. Any use of coercion, whether it be by the state, corporations, mobs, or individuals to suppress ideas is an attack on freedom of speech.</p></li>

        <p>Brittonic Memetics explains how Freedom of Speech as a social norm emerges when the cost of apostasy is low, or when the clannishness of a population is high.<p></li>

        <p>The supply of good ideas is likely finite. Once all the good ideas have already been claimed and published, i.e. humans have passed Peak Idea Production, there aren't many good ideas left to discover.<p></li>

    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-sixties.html">Why the 1960s were the cultural turning point for modernity in the West</a>
        <p>The counter-culture of the sixties was the result of the baby-boomers search for meaning after growing up in a stable, predictable environment everyday for years. The big problems of existence were relegated to obscurity again, handed back to the philosophers and the poets, and people went on with their lives.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/what-is-feminism.html">What is Feminism?</a>
        <p>From a purely biological perspective, Feminism is a memetic disease that denies biological realities and decreases reproductive success. Feminism does not demand true equality of outcomes between the sexes (the West has already achieved that). Instead, it is a utopian ideology that women can use to claim power, social status, moral superiority, and moral credit as oppressed victims.</p></li>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html?view=classic">Utopian Ideologies</a>
        <p>Every morally self-righteous person has what's called a Utopian Ideology, an unrealistic and tribalistic belief system that gives its adherents a claim to moral superiority and the illusion of knowledge. </p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-rhetoric-of-exploitation_21.html?view=classic">The Rhetoric of Exploitation</a>
        <p>A Classic Tactic used by Utopian Ideologists to replace rationalist thinking with rhetoric and self-righteous nonsense. The key is to use selective metaphors and phrases and portray the "oppressors" as having agency and the "victims" as having no agency.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2022/11/13/forbidden-knowledge/">Forbidden Knowledge</a>
        <p> Forbidden Knowledge gives the illusion of power and intellectual superiority. Adding an aura of secrecy and layered information to a memetic system can greatly improve its virulence.</p></li>

        <p>Human group behavior tends to follow a predictable pattern, and people who interact on a regular basis tend to synchronize their beliefs.</p></li>

        <p>Blithering Genius describes how fad movements work. Everybody wants to lead the herd, and everybody who isn't a leader wants to jump on the next bandwagon before anybody else. Purity-spiraling, radicalization, and declining growth eventually cause a feedback loop that causes bandwagon movements to shrink.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="culture/big-tent-strategy.html">The Big Tent Strategy for Growing Movements</a>
        <p>Out of necessity, many movements that follow this strategy will start out as big tents in order to grow, and then they radicalize once they're big enough.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTBPPc-IexI">Why Marriage is Beneficial for Human Societies</a>
        <p>Blithering Genius explains how marriage solves a major Prisoner's Dilemma and increases the stability of human societies and the genetic quality of human populations.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfqA_YvqDps">Modern Romance</a>
        <p>Blithering Genius explains why modernity has made it harder instead of easier for people to find a partner these days. By abandoning traditional sex roles and norms like marriage, modernity has broken the dating and mating game.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="culture/nature-of-discrimination.html">The Nature of Discrimination</a>
        <p>The right to discriminate is fundamental to life; Rational vs Irrational Forms of Discrimination; Lookism; Valuing diversity should also imply valuing discrimination.</p></li>
