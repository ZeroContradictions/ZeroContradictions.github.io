            <img src="images/georgism-flag-1.jpg" alt="Zero Contradictions">
            Hello and welcome to my philosophy blog. My name is ZeroContradictions, and on this home page you will find links to my philosophical writings <font color="red">(highlighted in red)</font>, as well as links to posts from blogs written by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy <font color="blue">(highlighted in blue)</font>, and links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <font color="green">(highlighted in green)</font>. As per its name, the goal of this blog is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that. The Modern World has reached an unprecedented level of insanity due to immense evolutionary mismatch, and it is now more important than ever to get the philosophical grounding necessary for solving the problems set before us.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: As of November 2022, the vast majority of the red link posts written by myself are unfinished, and have sections that need further elaboration and/or updating with my current beliefs, but I'm publishing what I have already written for now for others to read if they'd like. If you have any constructive criticism on this blog's HTML/CSS design (it's my first time designing a website), please reach out to me at <a class="ZC-essays" href="meta/contact.html">my contact page</a>. I will probably have to learn how to write some YAML code and better CSS in order to optimize this blog's design.

        <p>Blithering Genius explains how emotions generated motivation, which generates action. Increasing pain corresponds to increasing motivation, and decreasing motivation correlates with increasing pleasure.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="culture/objective-morality-nonsense.html">Post-Moralism: Why Objective Morality is Absolute Nonsense</a>
        <p>Game Theory is the best way to understand morality: perspective-dependent, and influenced by both selfishness and rationality.</p></li>

    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="FAQs/post-moralism-FAQs.html">FAQs About Post-Moralism, Selfishness, and Altruism</a>
        <p>Not believing in objective morals is similar to not believing in God, the rejection of an imaginary ontology that doesn't exist.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-lion-king-moral-narrative.html?view=classic">The Lion King Formula for Moral Narratives</a>
        <p>Most moral narratives revolve around Us Vs Them and Good Vs Evil, used by people for justification of their ideologies since the narratives fit their social instincts and worldview conditioned by the media. They are similar to the Walt Disney movies like the Lion King.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/07/what-is-morality.html?view=classic">What is Morality?</a>

    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/01/altruistic-morality-and-victimhood.html?view=classic">Altruistic Morality and Victimhood</a>
        <p>The moral framework of altruism does not lead to actual altruism. It leads to individuals seeking power through victimhood and eventual social collapse.</p></li>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html?view=classic">Utopian Ideologies</a>
        <p>Every morally self-righteous person has what's called a Utopian Ideology, an unrealistic and tribalistic belief system that gives its adherents a claim to moral superiority and the illusion of knowledge. </p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-rhetoric-of-exploitation_21.html?view=classic">The Rhetoric of Exploitation</a>
        <p>A Classic Tactic used by Utopian Ideologists to replace rationalist thinking with rhetoric and self-righteous nonsense. The key is to use selective metaphors and phrases and portray the "oppressors" as having agency and the "victims" as having no agency.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2022/11/13/forbidden-knowledge/">Forbidden Knowledge</a>

        <p>Blithering Genius describes how fad movements work. Everybody wants to lead the herd, and everybody who isn't a leader wants to jump on the next bandwagon before anybody else. Purity-spiraling, radicalization, and declining growth eventually cause a feedback loop that causes bandwagon movements to shrink.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="culture/big-tent-strategy.html">The Big Tent Strategy for Growing Movements</a>
        <p>Out of necessity, many movements that follow this strategy will start out as big tents in order to grow, and then they radicalize once they're big enough.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTBPPc-IexI">Why Marriage is Beneficial for Human Societies</a>
        <p>Blithering Genius explains how marriage solves a major Prisoner's Dilemma and increases the stability of human societies and the genetic quality of human populations.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfqA_YvqDps">Modern Romance</a>
        <p>Blithering Genius explains why modernity has made it harder instead of easier for people to find a partner these days. By abandoning traditional sex roles and norms like marriage, modernity has broken the dating and mating game.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="culture/nature-of-discrimination.html">The Nature of Discrimination</a>
        <p>The right to discriminate is fundamental to life; Rational vs Irrational Forms of Discrimination; Lookism; Valuing diversity should also imply valuing discrimination.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="culture/myth-of-racial-oppression.html">Why Racial Oppression Of Minorities In the United States Is A Complete Myth</a>
        <p>Racial Oppression is a myth spread by virtue-signaling, moral narratives, biological denialism, and a denial that modernity has achieve equal rights and equal opportunities for all.</p></li>

        <p>Freedom of speech exists to talk about controversial ideas from outside the Overton Window. This it is necessary for the best ideas to flourish. Any use of coercion, whether it be by the state, corporations, mobs, or individuals to suppress ideas is an attack on freedom of speech.</p></li>

        <p>The counter-culture of the sixties was the result of the baby-boomers search for meaning after growing up in a stable, predictable environment everyday for years. The big problems of existence were relegated to obscurity again, handed back to the philosophers and the poets, and people went on with their lives.</p></li>

        <p>From a purely biological perspective, Feminism is a memetic disease that denies biological realities and decreases reproductive success. Feminism does not demand true equality of outcomes between the sexes (the West has already achieved that). Instead, it is a utopian ideology that women can use to claim power, social status, moral superiority, and moral credit as oppressed victims.</p></li>

<h2 id="biological-realism">Understanding Biological Realism and Evolution</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>This section contains a list of essays by Blithering Genius about Biological Realism and Evolution, which I consider to be the best material there is on the Internet for fully understanding Evolution.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html?view=classic">Life is Intrinsically Violent</a>
        <p>Violence is inescapable from life due to the war, disease, and famine that are inevitably caused when a population reaches its carrying capacity.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html?view=classic">Why Selfishness Always Beats Altruism</a>
        <p>People will use and define "altruism" and "selfishness" in confusing ways, but the most coherent definition of "altruism" always loses to the most coherent definition of "selfishness", energetically, biologically, and psychologically.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K97OP2p9JTQ">Pathological Altruism</a>
        <p>Pathological Altruism is a phenomenon of collective irrationality caused by social delusion, and a virtue-signaling tragedy of the commons.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/rk-selection-theory-is-bogus.html?view=classic">Understanding Evolutionary Reasoning and why r/K Selection Theory is Bogus</a>
        <p>r/K Selection Theory is fallacious and has no explanatory power. The second half of this essay gives a great explanation of how evolution actually works.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/07/kin-selection-theory-is-wrong.html?view=classic">Why Kin Selection Theory is Wrong</a>
        <p>There is very little evidence of kin altruism in nature, other than parental care of offspring. Kin Altruism is a myth used to justify utopian ideologies.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/02/we-cannot-transcend-evolution.html?view=classic"> We Cannot Transcend Evolution</a>
        <p>We can never escape from the evolutionary process that creates and maintains the human form. We can change the environment in which this process operates, but we cannot escape from the process itself.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/bees-are-not-social.html?view=classic">Bees are not Social, Debunking Altruism Myths, and the Organism Unit of Selection</a>
        <p>An insight into bee biology. Moreover, bees are not altruistic, and the primary unit of selection for bees is the Queen since all genes flow through her.</p></li>

        <p>Ecosystems and organisms always tend towards evolutionary stable states.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/10/competition-in-nature.html?view=classic">Competition in Nature</a>
        <p>Competition in Nature exists between individuals, types/populations, genes/traits, and social groups. This essay talks about each of them.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/12/god-is-telomeme.html?view=classic">A Framework for Memetic Theory</a>
        <p>Memes can be divided into Traditions and Fashions / Cults, based on how they usually spread from one person to another.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html?view=classic">Adaptive Coherence</a>
        <p>Genes and memes work together hand-in-hand, and different biologies will produce different kinds of societies.</p></li>

    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/09/evolution-and-morality.html?view=classic">Evolution and Its Implications on Morality</a>
        <p>The simplest resolution to the conflicts between evolution and morality is to discard morality, but unfortunately it is easier for most people to reject the truth about life than to reject morality.</p></li>

        <p>Veritasium explains how there is no scientific evidence to prove that people can be categorized as visual, audible, or hands-on learners. If anything, all of those mediums of teaching should be used whenever they're appropriate for the situation, and the public's failure to realize this has diminished the quality of education worldwide.</p></li>

<h2 id="libertarianism">Why Libertarianism Is Impractical</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>I used to be a Libertarian and an Ancap myself for about 4 years, so I've spent hundreds of hours thinking about this stuff, hence why I have so many posts on this blog dedicated to writing my thoughts about Libertarianism and why it's naive.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="libertarianism/case-against-libertarianism.html">The Case Against Libertarianism and Anarchism</a>
        <p>This article explains why I eventually rejected both Libertarianism and Anarcho-Capitalism, why the NAP is bogus, and why libertarian societies are not sustainable.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="libertarianism/geolibertarian-syllogisms.html">GeoLibertarian Syllogisms</a>
        <p>Having an equal right to land is a negative right, and is also necessary for a truly free-market economy. Alloidal Libertarians contradict themselves on this, and this was the first issue that caused me to reject Libertarianism.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="libertarianism/malthusianism.html">Malthusianism Vs Cornucopianism: Why Cornucopianism is Wrong</a>

    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="libertarianism/rothbardian-ancapism-failures.html">Why Rothbardian Anarcho-Capitalism Would Fail Miserably</a>
        <p>Anarcho-Capitalism would replace government and political parties with morally-righteous political corporations that would fight each other constantly over power and morally superiority, thus combining tribal warfare and market failures with democracy's worst problems.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="libertarianism/free-markets-circular-reasoning.html">"Free" Markets In Ancapistan Would Have To Rely On Circular-Reasoning</a>
        <p>Government and the Rule of Law are necessary to establish the free market, lest the market be neither free nor fair.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="libertarianism/five-questions.html">Response to Larken Rose's Five Questions on Government</a>
        <p>The correct answers to Larken Rose's five questions are: Yes, Yes, N/A, Yes, and It depends. Larken Rose was the self-rightenous moron who persuaded me to join the Ancap cult until I left 2 years later.</p></li>

        <p>Adam Lanza's secret Youtube channel revealed his intentions. His personal philosophy (Euvalism, value spelled backwards) had similarities to Efilism, Antinatalism, and Anarcho-Primitivism, but it was also uniquely different, and emphasized a hatred for culture.

There are hundreds of benefits to using Emacs, including dramatically speed up the pace that I am able to create and publish content on this blog.
