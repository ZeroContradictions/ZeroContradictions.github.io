<h2 id="org05e8a23"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Negative Consequences Of Means-Tested Welfare</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They can be abused in various ways, such as by working on the black market, using false identities to claim extra benefits, or lying about family relationships.</li>
<li>They create a perverse incentive not to work. If a person on welfare gets a job, she loses her welfare benefits. This means that the net benefit from getting a job might be very small, especially considering the lost work at home and the costs of employment.</li>
<li>Means-tested welfare schemes also disincentivizes marriage and pair-bonding (because a husband&rsquo;s income might disqualify a woman from receiving benefits).</li>
<li>It creates a financial incentive to have more children, because welfare typically increases with each child.</li>
<li>The overall effect is a welfare-dependent culture of single mothers, short term sexual relationships, and black market employment (such as dealing illegal drugs).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org4e273a7"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Criticisms Against UBI In General (Longer Text)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>UBI would still require a bureaucracy. It would be less complex to administer and enforce per recipient, but it would be on a larger scale.</li>
<li>For those bearing the costs of the redistribution scheme, the state would not be viewed as parental, but as parasitic or predatory.</li>
<li>How much is a basic income? Would it apply the same across different regions with different costs of living, like New York City versus rural Montana?</li>
<li>Is a basic income for a paraplegic the same as a basic income for a healthy young person? What about medical and retirement benefits? Are those schemes subsumed by UBI, or do they exist in parallel?</li>
<li>UBI would make living off the government easier and more socially acceptable. The UBI would create a kind of dependency trap that is not as deep as welfare&rsquo;s, but much broader. Even if UBI reduces the disincentive for welfare recipients to work, it would create a much broader disincentive to work.</li>
<li>To get welfare, you have to qualify for it, and often you have to look for a job or demonstrate that you are unemployable. Welfare is low status compared to employment. Many people will not go on welfare because of the bureaucratic barriers to entry and/or because it is low status. Those barriers would be removed by UBI.</li>
<li>UBI may eliminate the financial incentive for welfare-dependent women to stay single, but it would further increase the financial independence of women from men, by giving women another source of support. Income is a source of male power and male attractiveness, and male power is perceived by women in relative terms, not absolute terms. Women want a man who makes more money than they do (and is taller, stronger, etc.). The more that wealth is transferred from men to women through the state, rather than through the pair-bond, the weaker the male-female pair-bond will become.</li>
<li>In the long run, the welfare state is unsustainable because it breeds an unproductive population. Some proponents of UBI believe that this problem would be reduced by UBI, because it would only be given to adults, and there would be no increase in benefits based on the number of children. However, in that case UBI would not replace existing welfare schemes, unless we were willing to allow children to live in abject poverty.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So, there would still be a need for other welfare programs or additional UBI based on the number of children.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Replacing exchange relationships with redistribution is generally destructive. It removes the incentive to be productive, it weakens the family, and it treats adults like children.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As a redistribution scheme, the UBI would have those general effects, although the strength of them is hard to predict. It would make people less dependent on employment, friends, and family, and thus it would weaken those relationships.</li>
<li>For example, it would make young adults less economically dependent on their parents. For those receiving net benefits, it would create an artificial parent-child relationship to the state, in which the state is viewed as a parent who hands out free goodies. Redistribution, in general, weakens both family and society.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The reproductive free ride problem (caused by welfare) has only two possible solutions in the long run: (1) allow children to die from poverty, or (2) coercively limit reproduction. (I have argued for the latter.)</li>
<li>If everyone were given $1000/month by the government, the entire economy and financial system would change in ways that are hard to predict.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There&rsquo;s no way to know exactly what would happen without doing the experiment, but we can say with absolute certainty that it would not give everyone $1000 more spending power at today&rsquo;s prices.</li>
<li>Instead, it would almost certainly reduce average spending power, because UBI would reduce the incentive to work, and thus reduce overall production. Lower production implies lower consumption.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The UBI proponent will typically commit the fallacy of composition in his arguments, often implicitly by appealing to intuition while not reasoning holistically. He will almost always argue from imaginary examples to conclusions that simply do not follow.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, he might say &ldquo;This will make it easier for women to stay home and look after children&rdquo;. Now, that could happen, but the opposite could also be true. It might seem intuitively obvious that single-income families would be better off, but we can&rsquo;t trust that intuition, because it is based on an implicit fallacy of composition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If I gave a family $2000/month extra without changing anything else, then of course that family would be better able to afford the mother staying home. But UBI would give EVERY family $2000/month extra, while also taxing them more, or printing money.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is easy to imagine giving $2000 to a family. It is hard to imagine the holistic effects of giving $2000 to every family.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>UBI would not make people better off on average, because no wealth is created by handing out money. It would change the distribution of spending power, thereby changing incentives, prices, and the entire economic system.</li>
<li>It is easy to imagine getting a bag of money, and how it would make your life better. That&rsquo;s why free lunch schemes often win elections, although they produce bad economic outcomes in practice. Intuition is a very poor guide to social policies, which is one of the many problems with democracy.</li>
<li>While it&rsquo;s worth thinking about a hypothetical post-work future, there isn&rsquo;t a shortage of work today. Some proponents of UBI believe that there is an imminent problem of automation replacing human labor. This &ldquo;imminent threat&rdquo; has been around since the days of the Luddites, but it hasn&rsquo;t materialized yet.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Automation has eliminated many jobs, but it isn&rsquo;t the main reason for structural unemployment in modern societies. In the West, unemployment is due to a combination of personal choice, mismatch between educational qualifications and labor force demand, women working instead of staying home, outsourcing labor to lower wage societies, and mass immigration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>UBI Proponents: People and current welfare recipients will still be incentivized to work if the UBI is not enough to pay for living expenses.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Also UBI Proponents: People will have so much more time on their hands to pursue creative or beneficial endeavors if they could work less.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note: This may be true for STEM researchers and inventors, but for everyone else, they would probably watch movies, play videogames, and other non-productive things, all while the increased taxes would harm the overall economic production.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It would be nice if every college student could receive free scholarships to pay for their college or if every aspiring researcher could receive a research grant that could fund their research, but donors don&rsquo;t give scholarships or research grants out to just <b>anyone</b>, they give their donations to people who demonstrate promise, dilligence, and merit. I&rsquo;m all for giving meritable people money so that they can pursue their lucrative non-profit endeavors, but UBI would also give money to people who don&rsquo;t display any merit at all, and that specifically is what I take issue with. That&rsquo;s why I want to consider the idea of only paying land rent to working individuals instead. They demonstrate merit, and if they receive more money (abolition of income taxes, re-distribution of land rent, and other Georgist-enhanced economic effects), then they could work less for saving up money for retirement, while also having more time to pursue their lucrative interests. Some people in the FI/RE Movement have managed to become millionaires by the time they become 30 years old.</li>
<li>Moreover, who should receive UBI? It ought to be contradictory to deny working minors (e.g. 16-year-old highschoolers who work part-time) a share of UBI just because they&rsquo;re not adults, while simultaneously rewarding adults like Doreen Ford with UBI just because they&rsquo;re over 18, even though they would choose to live off the government as much as possible. A working minor is surely more deserving of receiving some land rent than an unemployed adult who purposefully chooses to live off the government without contributing anything useful to society.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="orgfd276cb"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Non-Fallacious Benefits Of UBI That Don&rsquo;t Rely On Intuition Or The Fallacy Of Composition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are some non-fallacious arguments for UBI, but they depend on assumptions about the future. The most interesting, in my opinion, is the idea that we need to transition to a society that is less organized around work.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some people talk about a &ldquo;post-work&rdquo; future in which machines do almost all of the labor, and we have to find something else to do with our lives. This is interesting as a long-term possibility. What would a post-work future be like? How would we organize the distribution of goods and services? What would people do with their time? How would we measure the value of an individual to society?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Automation has eliminated many jobs, but it isn&rsquo;t the main reason for structural unemployment in modern societies. In the West, unemployment is due to a combination of personal choice, mismatch between educational qualifications and labor force demand, women working instead of staying home, outsourcing labor to lower wage societies, and mass immigration.</li>
<li>There are still plenty of jobs for human beings. We often hear arguments, especially from the left, that we need more immigrants to prevent a labor shortage, and to support an aging population.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we cut immigration and reduced out-sourcing (which we should do for other reasons anyway), there would be plenty of jobs in Western societies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is worth reevaluating the role of work in modern societies, and thinking about how it might change in the future. I agree with the view that our culture attaches too much importance to wage-labor, and too little importance to other kinds of labor, such as caring for one&rsquo;s own children, tending one&rsquo;s garden, writing in one&rsquo;s blog (my little garden of ideas), and so on. However, that is not an economic problem, but a psychological and philosophical one.</li>

<h2 id="org405d73d"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Counter-Arguments In Favor Of UBI</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>UBI is not as problematic for productivity as you think it might be. Even if it’s 15% of the workforce you lose by your productivity arguments it’s the bottom 15%. We can definitely afford to lose that many minimum wage workers.</li>
<li>With an LVT funded UBI in order to live without working they will have to choose to live in cheap areas which will create downward pressure on rents in prime areas from a 15% reduction in demand.</li>
<li>You also have to keep in mind the work reduction from welfare is non-zero so it’s quite possible the work reduction from UBI ends up lower since the UBI doesn’t have work-preventing cliffs.</li>
<li>Furthermore, a study recently came out showing a person denied welfare was nearly 2-1 more likely to commit an income related crime than to get a job that paid $15,000/year or more.  So if we make welfare access effectively universal we dramatically reduce income related crime.</li>

<h2 id="orgbe5f35a"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Criticisms Against UBI In General (Summarized Bullet Points)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>However, UBI would make the economy less productive because it would reduce the incentive for ALL individuals to work.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If UBI is not funded by LVT, then the aggregate decrease in production would at least double, since productive work would be taxed even more than it is now.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The amount of &ldquo;Basic Income&rdquo; is vaguely defined. Places with higher costs of living may require higher Basic Incomes.</li>
<li>UBI would ultimately fail to replace other forms of welfare. Since everybody would receive the same amount of Basic Income, disabled people or single mothers with however many children wouldn&rsquo;t receive enough welfare since UBI would place a cap on that. The &ldquo;altruistic&rdquo; leftists would be abhored by this, they would thus demand that those people receive greater UBIs, and this would in turn defeat the fallacious theoretical motives of UBI. That is:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>UBI would not incentivize welfare recipients under the current system to work (since the leftists would still insist that those people should still receive more welfare under UBI anyway),</li>
<li>Nor would UBI disincentivize single mothers from having more children (assuming there is no tax on procreation) ).</li>
<li>And even if the righteous altruistic leftists held to their word that UBI would still be exactly the same for current welfare recipients as everyone else, children and functionally-disabled people (e.g. the severely autistic, paraplegics) would have to die from poverty, unless we coercively limit reproduction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>UBI would further increase the financial independence of women from men, by giving women another source of support. Income is a source of male power and male attractiveness, and male power is perceived by women in relative terms, not absolute terms. Women want a man who makes more money than they do (and is taller, stronger, etc.). The more that wealth is transferred from men to women through the state, rather than through the pair-bond, the weaker the male-female pair-bond will become. UBI (and redistribution in general) would further deteriorate existing social bonds.</li>
<li>UBI would weaken parent-child relationships since young adults become less economically dependent on their parents.</li>
<li>UBI would still require a bureaucracy. It would be less complex to administer and enforce per recipient, but it would be on a larger scale.</li>
<li>If just one family is given $2000/month extra without changing anything else, then of course that family would be better able to afford the mother staying home. But UBI would give EVERY family $2000/month extra, while also levying more taxes to pay for it.</li>
<li>If everyone were given $1000/month by the government, the entire economy and financial system would change in ways that are hard to predict (aside from what has already been stated).</li>
<li>A hypothetical post-work future still has yet to materialize due to automation, if it even ever will.</li>
<li>There are better ways to reduce unemployment in the West by adressing the following:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People&rsquo;s personal choices,</li>
<li>Mismatch between educational qualifications and labor force demand,</li>
<li>Women working instead of staying home,</li>
<li>If we cut immigration and out-source fewer jobs to lower-wage societies overseas (which we should do for other reasons anyway), there would be plenty of jobs in Western societies.</li>

<li>Requiring a reproductive license and tax in order to have children.</li>
<li>The most basic functions of government: law enforcement, court system, military, border patrol, coast guard, foreign affairs, fire departments, emergency services, etc</li>
<li>Hard infrastructure: roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband access).</li>
<li>Soft infrastructure: educational programs, official statistics, parks and recreational facilities, etc.</li>
<li>K-12 Education?</li>

<li>Singapore&rsquo;s Welfare System, plus some amount of LBI?</li>
<li>Laborers&rsquo; Bonus Income (LBI)?: Laborers who work are paid LVT by the government for working. A percentage of the worker&rsquo;s salary (as determined by the government) is paid in addition to whatever the worker is paid by the employer.</li>

<p>
Laborers&rsquo; Bonus Income (LBI): Laborers who work are paid LVT by the government for working.
</p>

<p>
This would have all the benefits of Land Value Tax (no land speculation, more efficient land usage, no taxation on production, affordable housing, reduced pollution, no land monopolies, reduced wealth inequality, etc),
</p>

<p>
Not only that, but it also wouldn&rsquo;t suffer the drawbacks of UBI (decreased incentive to work, decreased production, weakened male-female pair bond, weakened parent-child relationships, etc.
</p>

<p>
Since workers wouldn&rsquo;t pay any income taxes, they would be incentivized to work more.
</p>

<p>
However, since workers also would receive money from the LVT-funded LBI just by the virtue of working, this might cancel out the benefits of abolishing income taxes, since workers would have to work less to make a living and save for retirement.
</p>

<p>
On the bright side, since there would be a significantly reduced welfare state, and the LVT revenue would not be paid to people who don&rsquo;t work, LBI would not subsidize people who don&rsquo;t want to work at all.
