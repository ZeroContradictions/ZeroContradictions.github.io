<h2 id="orgeb39269"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Thoughts When I Was Brainstorming Laborers&rsquo; Bonus Income (LBI)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>QUESTION: What if instead of LVT and UBI, landowners who are running businesses were required to pay their workers higher wages, in accordance to the value of the land that they own? That way, we could avoid the harmful societal effects of UBI, while simultaneously ensuring that land values are more equitably distributed among all humans? People would also be required to work for the wages (which would be higher), and this would keep the sexual market balanced.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since the lowest wages are set by what someone could earn by laboring the most valuable unclaimed land that is available to be labored, it makes more sense to base LBI as a percentage of the worker&rsquo;s salary that gets added onto what the worker would get paid by the employer. Valuable land exists in finite supply, and there is a finite number of jobs for working the most valuable land, so it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to require employers to pay their employees according to the land value that the employees are working on.</li>
<li>Moreover, LVT is collected by the government, so the government (not the employers) would be responsible for distributing the land rent to the workers.</li>
<li>That being said, the most reasonable way to distribute land rent would be to increase every laborer&rsquo;s salary in proportion to what their labor is worth (the wage that their employer pays them).</li>

<h2 id="orgb809724"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Laborers&rsquo; Bonus Income (LBI)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Laborers&rsquo; Bonus Income (LBI): Laborers who work are paid LVT by the government for working.</li>
<li>This would have all the benefits of Land Value Tax (no land speculation, more efficient land usage, no taxation on production, affordable housing, reduced pollution, no land monopolies, reduced wealth inequality, etc),</li>
<li>Not only that, but it also wouldn&rsquo;t suffer the drawbacks of UBI (decreased incentive to work, decreased production, weakened male-female pair bond, weakened parent-child relationships, etc.</li>
<li>Since workers wouldn&rsquo;t pay any income taxes, they would be incentivized to work more.</li>
<li>However, since workers also would receive money from the LVT-funded LBI just by the virtue of working, this might cancel out the benefits of abolishing income taxes, since workers would have to work less to make a living and save for retirement.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People will work more if they get paid more, since getting paid more provides an increased incentive to work. However, for people doing FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), most of them will only work up to a certain point once they have reached their target savings and investment. If they reach their targeted savings amount after working fewer hours under LBI instead of however many more hours that they would work without LBI, then they would work less overall.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, it should also be considered that earning more money for the same amount of work would enable them to live less frugally and more lavishly during the years that they are working, which would partially counter-balance the lower amount of work that they would be doing due to receiving an LBI.</li>
<li>Additionally, even if LBI enables FIRE-movement laborers to retire earlier, those laborers would have to save up some additional money for the additional retirement years that they will be able to have, which would also partially counter-balance the fewer working hours made possible by LBI.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a country where over 50% of employees live paycheck-to-paycheck, LBI would definitely increase those workers&rsquo; disposable incomes, reverse declining fertility rates, and allow the workers to retire earlier. This is far better than what we have now, and the other negative consequences of our Anti-Georgist economic system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the bright side, since there would be a significantly reduced welfare state, and the LVT revenue would not be paid to people who don&rsquo;t work, LBI would not subsidize people who don&rsquo;t want to work at all.</li>
</ul>


<p>
ELABORATE ON THIS: Highlight the contradictions in not giving working minors (e.g. 16-year-old highschoolers who work part-time) a share of UBI just because they&rsquo;re not adults.
</p>

<p>
ELABORATE ON THIS: Another contradiction is how UBI would reward adults who don&rsquo;t want to work at all and will only live off of UBI.
</p>

<p>
It is contradictory to deny working minors (e.g. 16-year-old highschoolers who work part-time) a share of UBI just because they&rsquo;re not adults, while simultaneously rewarding adults like Doreen Ford with UBI just because they&rsquo;re over 18, even though they would choose to live off the government as much as possible.
</p>



<p>
It would be even better to just pay a flat LBI rate to all workers, it would just be higher than whatever UBI would pay since it&rsquo;s divided up by a smaller subset of the entire human population.
Workers that are paid more may not necessarily be more deserving of LBI, especially since there will probably never be working efficiency due to the mismatch of incentives between employers, employees, investors, customers, and more.
Not only that, but this would increase income inequality. When every worker receives a flat amount of LBI, everything would work mostly the same as it is now. Every worker would just earn more money and be able to retire earlier.
</p>

<p>
A merit-based assessment would be best for distributing land rent revenues to everybody.
A workers-only distribution of land rents would be the next best since people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get away with living off of UBI.
Whether LVT-funded UBI or LBI is in place, everybody would receives it would be better off, unless they pay more significantly more LVT than what they receive in UBI or LBI.
A majority of the people who receive land rents collected by LVT probably won&rsquo;t use it to enable themselves to do more creative things or good things that don&rsquo;t make a profit (despite being &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;favorable&rdquo;).
    The only way to solve this problem would be to use bottom-up eugenics that will select for people who produce, invent, research, and innovate the most, otherwise known as people who give back to society more than whatever they take from it.
Without a merit-based award system for distributing land rents to the best and more productive people, LBI is theorized to be marginally better than UBI because it makes it impossible to live off of nothing but UBI. LBI is also theorized to prevent traditional familial relationships from deteriorating since only breadwinners receive the land rents, not the people who depend on the breadwinners.
If there was a eugenics system that implicitly selects for people who produce more than what they take, UBI may be able to work, but if and only if the genes that produce such people stay constant, and there doesn&rsquo;t evolve any mutations that could create a member of society and their descendents who live off UBI and take more than what they give back.
If LVT is distributed only to the workers and all existing welfare programs are abolished, then this would decrease the increasing number of single parents. The current welfare system gives welfare to parents who can&rsquo;t afford to take care of all their children, but Georgism + Laborer&rsquo;s Bonus Income wouldn&rsquo;t do that. Furthermore, removing welfare in favor of LVT-funded LBI would encourage people who would otherwise be single parents to find a partner before they have and raise children, lest they starve, since raising children <b>should</b> be a two-person task with one parent working and the other caring for the children and doing homemaking.
