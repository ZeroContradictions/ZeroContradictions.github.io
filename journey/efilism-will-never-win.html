<h2 id="DTT"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Efilists Are Wrong About Demographic Transition Theory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-DTT">
<p>
One of the reasons why the Efilists believe that they have a chance at achieving their ultimate goal &ldquo;the Benevolent World Exploder&rdquo; is that most of them believe in Demographic Transition Theory.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for their movement, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/demography-and-destiny.html?view=classic">Demographic Transition Theory is wrong</a>. Although Inmendham has repeatedly advocated in favor of it many times, but he is completely wrong that educating people in developing countries and raising living standards the rest of the world will lead to a long-term decline in global fertility rates, as it could only be a temporary decline at most.
</p>

<p>
The religious fundamentalists and other people with the highest fertility rates will out-compete the rest of the entire world, and the genes and memes that caused child-free people to choose not to have children will die out. The end result is that the genes that caused higher fertility rates will become more populous, and this will cause the world population to skyrocket once more until it crashes against the carrying capacity ceiling. The world population will <b>not</b> max out at 11-12 billion people, and if it does, that will only be because the world population reached the carrying capacity of the Earth.
</p>

<p>
Why haven&rsquo;t Efilists figured this out though? They believe in one of the only philosophies on Earth that is based on extensive evolutionary reasoning, and yet they have made a completely wrong conclusion about the long-term future of the world&rsquo;s human population.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-self-defeating" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="self-defeating"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Because It Is A Self-Defeating Ideology</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-self-defeating">
<p>
<a href="../culture/objective-morality-nonsense.html">Why Objective Morality is Absolute Nonsense</a>
</p>

<p>
Of course, Efilists will probably respond to the above post that &ldquo;But value should not exist&rdquo;, but if they say this, then they would be contradicting themselves. Because then they would be valuing the absence of value. Not even a Benevolent World Exploder Proposal can be considered &ldquo;objectively good&rdquo;, because it can only be morally right from a perspective that values the absence of value.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the Efilists do not have a right to unilaterally decide that it is best to kill everyone. Morality is subjective, so Efilists can only be subjective right about their moral beliefs at most.
</p>

<p>
Efilism will <i>never</i> win, because it is self-defeating, intrinsically contradictory, and diametrically opposed to the Universe itself.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Efilism is philosophically self-defeating because it values the absence of value, a performative contradiction.</li>
<li>Efilism is biologically self-defeating because altruism <i>never</i> wins selfishness in Evolutionary Theory.</li>
<li>Efilism is psychologically self-defeating because it is incompatible with the psychological desires to have sex and raise children.</li>
<li>Efilism is ethically self-defeating because it argues that it is immoral to have children without their prior consent, but it also argues that it is ethical to euthanize people without their consent.</li>
<li>Efilism is physically self-defeating because the end of life would never be the complete uninhabitability of the Earth, but rather &ldquo;we have to travel across the galaxy to locations X, Y, and Z to eradicate all the life on those planetary bodies as well! And then we must eradicate the life at locations A, B, C, D, E, F G, H, &#x2026;. and so on&#x2026;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>
You are a reproducing machine, whether you like it or not. You can choose to embrace that, or you can choose to detest it. But it you choose the latter, then you will never have a consistent philosophy because you will <i>always</i> be at odd with your own desires, emotions, and instincts.
</p>

<p>
In any case, it will always make vastly more sense to kill people who <b>don&rsquo;t</b> want to live than to kill people who <b>do</b> want to live.

<h2 id="annihilation-of-efilists"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Because The Natalists Would Destroy The Efilists If Their Movement Ever Did Grow Large Enough</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-annihilation-of-efilists">
<blockquote>
<p>
Will Efilism become a movement someday?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No, because if Efilism ever does grow big enough (say millions of self-identified Efilists), the Natalists will make the natural choice to kill and destroy <i>all</i> of the Efilists. The Efilists have literally already said that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7mt5B3WvrE">they would skin literally everybody alive and destroy the Earth if they had the means to do it</a>, so the Natalists would conclude that if they want to continue living, then they&rsquo;ll have to kill and purge every single Efilist in the name of what they would they would call &ldquo;Self-Defense&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
If the Efilists ever dared to destroy the Earth, it would be very easy to get public support to arrest and execute all the Efilists before they could ever begin to carry it out. Governments all over the world would pass legislation declaring Efilists to be enemies of the State, and they would all be sentenced to death. If the Efilists believe that they could potentially accomplish their ultimate goal by doing activism and spreading the word, then they really haven&rsquo;t thought this through all the way. It&rsquo;s really weird how they&rsquo;ll talk with other Efilists on public forums like r/Efilism about their plans to destroy the Earth, as if there isn&rsquo;t anyone listening in on them that would be keen to stop them in their tracks and punish them.
</p>

<p>
Most Efilists hate their lives and would rather be dead instead of alive anyways, so if all of them were killed by the natalists (who want to live before they killed the natalists themselves, the deaths of the Efilists could be further rationalized as having done a favor for most of them. After all, doesn&rsquo;t it make more sense to kill/euthanize people who <b>don&rsquo;t</b> want to live than to kill people who <b>do</b> want to live?
</p>

<p>
Natalists could also rationalize eliminating all of them. Most of the Efilists hate their lives and wish that they had never born in the first place, so if the Efilists were all put to sleep, not only would the Natalists be saving themselves in case the Efilists ever get out of control, but we would also be doing them a favor by putting an end to their lives which they wish they never had in the first place. Just because they hate their lives, that shouldn&rsquo;t mean that people who enjoy their lives shouldn&rsquo;t have to have theirs end as well.

<p>
I&rsquo;m all for supporting truly free speech, and I think that more discussion about Efilism as a philosophy should be encouraged, but where I draw the line is when Efilists are trying to recruit people to do harmful, illegal, and threatening activity.

<h2 id="ignorance-of-efilists"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> The Vast Ignorance Of Anti-Natalists And Efilists, With Examples</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ignorance-of-efilists">
<p>
Efilists and Anti-Natalists are ignorant. Since they&rsquo;ve rejected life and are only focused on destroying it, they don&rsquo;t care much at all about developing a good understanding of the world. Some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They aren&rsquo;t interested in understanding epistemology and critical thinking skills. They are only interested in destroying the Earth and humanity.</li>
<li>Many of them don&rsquo;t have any interest in thinking about philosophy beyond negative utilitarian ethics, leftist/communist ideas. The end result is massive ignorance.</li>
<li>For so many of them, they would hardly have any identity left if they couldn&rsquo;t define themselves as atheist, vegan, efilist/anti-natalist/pro-mortalist/VHEMT, etc.</li>
<li>They tried a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/oed-uk-oup-com-make-antinatalism-a-word-in-the-dictionary">prescriptivist attempt to put an entry about antinatalism into English dictionaries</a>, without understanding that dictionaries are supposed to be descriptivist, non-partisan, and based on corpus data.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note: Antinatalism did eventually make it into many modern English dictionaries a few years after they first attempted their activist project, but that was only because the increase in online and published material talking about antinatalism finally meant the lexicographers&rsquo; standards for what can and cannot be included in their dictionaries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>They incorrectly predicted that the COVID-19 lockdowns would cause a baby boom, when in fact they actually caused a sharp decline in the population growth rate.</li>
<li>They believe in altruism, but most of them fail to recognize that <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html?view=classic">altruism will eventually lose as evolution takes its course</a>.</li>
<li>Efilists have high hopes that fewer births will result due to the conditions of modernity and education, but they fail to realize that this evolutionary mismatch won&rsquo;t last forever because <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/demography-and-destiny.html?view=classic">Demographic Transition Theory is wrong</a> and birth control is the real factor that controls the decline in human populations and population growth rates.</li>
<li>They believe that more Efilists will keep being born for the same reason why gay people keep being born even though both lead to reproductive demise, but this is also wrong to an extent since Efilism and Anti-Natalism are memetic diseases that are destined to decline in popularity.</li>
<li>They fail to recognize the performative contradiction in valuing the absence of value.</li>
<li>Hard-core Efilists claim to be against suffering, and yet they&rsquo;re willing to cause any amount of suffering that they believe is necessary just to kill everyone and destroy the Earth.</li>
<li>Many Efilists believe that Inmendham is a master debater, but he clearly isn&rsquo;t. He doesn&rsquo;t watch his opponents response videos in their entirety, nor does he address the actual arguments being made by his opponents. He just throws ad hominem after ad hominem, analogy after analogy, blabbers on while &ldquo;disagreeing to agree&rdquo;, and he gets hung up on terminology. And this is ultimately to the detriment of their movement since they have no counter-arguments against these arguments, and because they&rsquo;re just watching Inmendham without watching the original video, they&rsquo;re obliviously unaware of what some valid counter-arguments against Efilism even are.</li>
<li>Many Efilists believe that Inmendham&rsquo;s Bitforce Theory of Physics is right, but it has absolutely no scientific consensus and basic calculus contradicts the theory, instead of backing it up.</li>
<li>Many of them believe in objective morality, but this is easy to debunk.</li>
<li>Many of them mistakenly believe that reason is the basis for said objective morality, but this is also debunked since morality depends on subjective values, not sound reasoning.</li>
<li>Most of them assume altruism and negative hedonism to be self-evident, but they&rsquo;re not self-evident.</li>
<li>Most of them are Leftists, Communists, and/or Anarcho-Communists. They are clueless about economics, and they fail to recognize that Georgism is the correct solution to most of our main economic problems, woes, and inequalities.</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>i</li>
</ul>
<p>
One of the biggest reasons why I personally reject Efilism is because as soon as someone wholeheartedly rejects life, there is no reason to explore the rest of philosophy. If someone does learn about Efilism, it shouldn&rsquo;t be the end of their philosophical exploration. If anything, it should be just the beginning. Knowledge is arguably the ultimate value, or at least one of them, since knowledge is necessary to conclude Efilism. Thus, even if someone is inclined to accept Efilism upon being introduced to it, how can they know for sure that they&rsquo;re right if the poverty of knowledge (Plato&rsquo;s Problem) could lead virtually anyone to believe in potentially anything?
