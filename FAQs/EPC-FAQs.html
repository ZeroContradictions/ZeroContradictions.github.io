<p>
It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that in several ways, there is already popular support for some widely practiced and commonly accepted forms of Eugenics in modern society. Those instances just aren&rsquo;t called Eugenics when they occur. Some examples include: aborting fetuses that have severe birth defects, outlawing incest between close relatives, and how some sperm and egg banks prohibit donations from people who have ADHD, ASD, or do not meet certain height requirements. I support all those instances of eugenics, except for the last one, which I explain here: <a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">Why Laissez-Faire Eugenics is the best</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-we-want">
<p>
In order to prevent war, disease, and famine, there must be a maximum population limit enforced for the country&rsquo;s total number of citizens. In order to enforce that population limit, anybody who wants to have children must acquire a Reproduction License for each child that they want to have. Everybody else who is unauthorized to have (more) children must have mandatory contraception, since that is the only way to ensure that people do not create legally unauthorized offspring.

<h2 id="why-control-reproduction"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Why do you want to control Reproduction?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-control-reproduction">
<p>
If we don&rsquo;t regulate reproduction, then we are destined to face overpopulation, and potentially <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html?view=classic">some combination of war and famine</a>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the social control of reproduction is not a new idea. It is a very old and almost universal practice. In the past, reproduction was controlled by the institution of marriage. Almost every society had some form of marriage that regulated human sexual behavior. Sex outside marriage was not allowed. We abandoned the traditional control of reproduction without understanding its function or the consequences of abandoning it. We are now seeing the consequences (and paying the costs) of abandoning marriage. It is time to replace marriage with a modern form of reproduction control.

<h2 id="why-implement-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Why do you want to implement Eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-implement-eugenics">
<p>
For one thing, we live in a time where there is great evolutionary mismatch between the people living in society, and the modern environment that we humans have created. Biological evolution is slower than cultural evolution and humans evolve more slowly than pathogens.
</p>

<p>
One of the strongest, arguments in favor of eugenics is how evolution is <i>not</i> guided by a human brain. Again, it must be stated and emphasized that the humans that did get to pass their genes onto the next generation only had to be <i>smart enough</i> to build shelter, hunt and gather food/water, and raise healthy children for the next generation. It could be argued that evolution simply hasn&rsquo;t gone far enough in selecting more intelligent humans.

<p>
If you value the sustaining modern, industrial technological civilization, then no. Modern civilization will collapse if we don&rsquo;t implement EPC: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/11/dysgenics-overpopulation-and.html?view=classic">Overpopulation and Conventional Ignorance</a>
</p>

<p>
Even worse, if modern civilization collapses, it will probably never recover since fossil fuels that powered it will already be all used up, and the necessary energy won&rsquo;t exist anymore to restart industrial civilization. The scientific knowledge, technological complexity, social complexity, and economic complexity will all fall apart if that happens: <a href="https://notetoworld.org/index.php?loc=note&amp;key=60a6647e-766e-42de-a3e4-6bbbf864a4d5">Why Modern Civilization Will Never Recover If It Falls</a>

<p>
Additionally, if someone is going to be of the position that eugenics is always bad under all circumstances, then they ought to be against the widely practiced and socially acceptable forms of eugenics mentioned in this section: <a href="#eugenics-in-modern-society">Eugenics in Modern Society</a>

<div id="outline-container-overpopulation-and-eugenics" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="overpopulation-and-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">9.</span> What is the connection between Overpopulation and Eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-overpopulation-and-eugenics">
<p>
When a population reaches the carrying capacity of its environment, competition and eugenic selection occur in order to select the organisms that are the most reproductively successful in the scarce resources environment.
</p>

<p>
By removing the selectionary pressures on humanity and limitations that have traditionally limited the carrying capacity of the human population, not only does this cause dysgenics from the removal of said selectionary pressures, but it also causes overpopulation. That said, if we achieved legally-enforced population control for humanity, then we would be placing artificial selectionary pressures that will increase the eugenic quality of the human population, that would otherwise never occur.
</p>

<p>
If someone is going to be in favor of population control, ought to be in favor of bottom-up eugenics as well (top-down eugenics would fail the same reason why command economies fail). Many people today are against eugenics because it would require restricting some people from having children, but population control does the same thing and population control will be necessary in order to prevent catastrophic disasters from happening in the future, so this is not a good argument against eugenics.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-georgism-and-eugenics">
<p>
Georgist reasoning compliments the population control scheme that we want to implement extremely well, and not by coincidence if we expand the notion of &ldquo;natural resources&rdquo; to also include the finite supply of organisms that can exist within a finite environment. Since life is a zero-sum competition game for energy when a population reaches its carrying capacity, anybody who has children in such an environment would be doing so at the cost of preventing other people to have children as well. This is very similar to how anybody who occupies a parcel of land prevents other people from using that parcel. I explain this topic in more detail in my blog post: <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">Why Georgism And EPC Both Imply Each Other</a>
</p>

</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ve established in the previous question how overpopulation is connected to eugenics, and now we&rsquo;ve established how georgism is connected to regulating overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
TL;DR: Georgism implies Population Control, which implies Eugenics.

<h3 id="reproduction-tax-conditions"><span class="section-number-3">10.2.</span> Under what conditions would the Reproduction Tax not be applied?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-reproduction-tax-conditions">
<p>
The conditions are easy to understand, provided that you have an understanding of both Georgism <i>and</i> population dynamics.
</p>

<p>
If EPC was enacted in a country, and the number of people who apply for reproduction licenses is smaller than the number of babies that can be born within that year, then there would be no tax on reproduction. This is just like how there is no need to tax land or natural resources in order to solve the tragedy of the commons with regards to scarce resources if there is plenty of valuable land for everybody.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, since populations naturally reproduce up to the carrying capacities of their environments when the species is well-adapted to its environment, then the population would spend most of its time in an Evolutionarily Stable State (ESS), so there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need to worry about whether or not the population will have enough children up to the Legal Maximum Population Limit. But in the event that the population is significantly lower than the carrying capacity, then <a href="#reproduction-tax-conditions">there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need to tax reproduction at all</a>. Since the population of the EPC country would spend most of its time the legally maximum population limit with very fluctuation from one year to the next, the population size would be very constant for many years or decades, assuming that the government doesn&rsquo;t pass a law to change the maximum population birth rate, and no unexpected events like war occur.

<h2 id="licenses-and-elderly"><span class="section-number-2">11.</span> Would reproduction licenses require killing the elderly if too many people are born in one year?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-licenses-and-elderly">
<p>
No, because this misunderstands what the reproduction licenses are for. They are not a license for a person to live, they are a license for a married couple to have a child in one if they meet the requirements. Since only a finite maximum number of children can be born within each year, this would mean that the total population of the country would have very little variation and would stay roughly constant for many years or decades, assuming that the government doesn&rsquo;t pass a law to change the maximum population birth rate.

<div id="outline-container-georgist-reasoning-and-elderly" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="georgist-reasoning-and-elderly"><span class="section-number-3">11.1.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t Georgist reasoning conclude that State-Control Population Control would require killing the elderly if the population becomes too large?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-georgist-reasoning-and-elderly">
<p>
Some Georgists might object that if we limit the number of people who can be born each year on the basis that it is economic land (every married couple needs a license for each child that they have), then everybody also needs a license to live since the country has a legal maximum population size, and therefore only a finite number of people can live in the country at a time. But this does not follow because under the EPC system that we are proposing, there would be some amount of buffer room between the legal maximum population limit and the carrying capacity of the environment to avoid overpopulation, so if the carrying capacity dropped during an emergency, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a need to decide who gets to live and who doesn&rsquo;t, nor would it be necessary to kill off the most elderly members of the society in the event of an overpopulation crisis (when the population is dangerously higher than the carrying capacity).

<div id="outline-container-how-to-enforce-EPC" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="how-to-enforce-EPC"><span class="section-number-2">12.</span> How would you enforce an EPC system with Reproduction Licenses?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-how-to-enforce-EPC">
<p>
There are various ways to do it. If necessary, a mandatory form of legally-approved birth control can be enforced 24/7, unless the citizen has a reproduction license to authorize a pregnancy.
</p>

<p>
Anybody who manages to illegally have a child without a reproduction license would have committed a felony. A person who violates the policy will have their embryo aborted, could be sterilized, and/or forced to be on birth control until they can repay society for the incurred costs of supporting the child.
</p>

<p>
Supervised birth control and regular testing should be required for people on welfare and convicted criminals.
</p>

<p>
Everybody else who is unauthorized to have (more) children must have mandatory contraception, since that is the only way to ensure that people do not create legally unauthorized offspring.

<div id="outline-container-banning-female-infanticide" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="banning-female-infanticide"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t regulating reproduction cause female infanticide in countries like China and India?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-banning-female-infanticide">
<p>
No, because we can assume that any government that has the power to enforce EPC would also have the authority to enforce a law that bans female infanticide. In the interest of ensuring an equalized sex ratio for the country&rsquo;s population, female infanticide will be outlawed, unless it can be proven that the fetus/infant had severe birth defects, a severe genetic disease, etc. If it married couples were tempted to kill their female children because they wanted a son instead, then the government could simply create a law that forbids that married couple from ever possessing another reproduction license and the couple would not get a refund, which would guarantee an equalized demographic sex ratio. All parents must accept the sex of the child that they give birth to, or else they will be forbidden from having any children at all.
</p>

<p>
Since a married couple would have to have a reproduction license <i>before</i> they conceive a child in the womb, the government could ensure that that the child will be born by contractually requiring the prospective parents to carry the child until birth, regardless of the sex of the fetus. This would prevent couples from trying to abort female fetuses while they are still in the womb. If the child was aborted for any reason, then the reason has to be documented. If the reason for the abortion was merely because the fetus was female, then the couple would permanently lose their reproductive rights and would not get a refund.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, since shifting to a relatively low fertility country (in comparison to historical trends) would necessitate that women would be spending more time doing other things besides just raising children, that should cause female children to be perceived as being more valuable in countries where female infanticide is a cultural problem, which would further help to reduce the problem altogether.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if a couple of parents only had daughters born, but they still wanted a son, then they can still have a son as long as they buy another reproduction license and they happen to give birth to a son. Generally speaking however, creating artificial barriers to reproduction would make having children of higher social status because having children would become harder to achieve. This is a good thing because it would cause parents to value their children more, regardless of whatever sex they children may be born as.

<h2 id="not-authoritarian"><span class="section-number-2">16.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t EPC be horribly authoritarian?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-authoritarian">
<p>
No. It would be no more authoritarian than limiting the freedom to drive or the freedom to kill other people. Reproduction has serious consequences that can be harmful to others, and so the imposition of social constraints on reproduction is justified for the same reason that social constraints on other behaviors are justified. Reproduction licenses are the simplest, most practical, and least authoritarian solution to save the world from the war and famine that will result from overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
Also, licenses are already required to adopt children, so there&rsquo;s no reason why it should be considered any more authoritarian to require licenses for people to have biological children.

No. It would be easier than enforcing many current laws, including traffic regulations and the law against murder.

<p>
That&rsquo;s a silly objection (and an Appeal to Nature Fallacy?). What is the natural order of things? Until recently, most children died young. Now, with modern civilization (based on fossil fuels) we allow most children to live to adulthood. If eugenics violates the natural order then so does modern civilization. And without eugenics modern civilization is unsustainable. Eugenic population control is needed to balance the effects of modern prosperity on the human population. We could use eugenic population control to create a new &ldquo;natural order&rdquo; of sustainable prosperity. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we? Nature will not strike us down for using eugenics. In fact, the opposite is true. Nature will eventually destroy our civilization if we don&rsquo;t regulate our population eugenically.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nazis-were-dysgenicists">
<p>
Eugenics ≠ Nazism. If anything, the Nazis failed to implement eugenics on a scientific/rational basis. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that blonde hair, blue eyes, white skin, and other &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; physical characteristics lead to higher intelligence. So from a scientific perspective, the Nazis did <i>not</i> advocate for policies that enforced positive eugenics. For someone who purportedly promoted positive eugenics, Hitler only did that in name only, and in fact accomplished the exact opposite of that. Instead of encouraging the reproduction of people who were scientifically proven to be more intelligent, physically-fit, etc than the average human, Hitler killed millions of people from one of the most influential ethnic groups in history relative to its size: the Jews. Given the Jews&rsquo; strong record of making scientific accomplishments, contributing to human progress, and acquiring positions of power, killing millions of them is the opposite of what someone should be doing if they want to promote positive eugenic traits like intelligence or physical fitness.
</p>

<p>
For someone who purportedly promoted positive eugenics, Hitler only did that in name only, and in fact accomplished the exact opposite of that. That&rsquo;s what the Nazis <b>said</b> they were doing, but what were they <b>actually</b> doing? Instead of breeding people who were scientifically proven to be more intelligent, physically-fit, etc than the average human, he killed millions of people from the most successful ethnic group in history: the Jews. Given the Jews&rsquo; strong record of making scientific accomplishments, contributing to human progress, and acquiring positions of power, killing millions of them is the opposite of what someone should be doing if they want to promote positive eugenic traits like intelligence or physical fitness.
</p>

<p>
Instead, the Nazis promoted racist, pseudo-scientific garbage, and used that as an excuse for killing some of the most productive members of society. I would like to very strongly emphasize to the fullest extent possible that Racism is <i>not</i> eugenics. The Nazis merely used eugenics as a cover justification for killing people during the Holocaust.
</p>

<p>
However, it can be clearly argued that the Nazis did promote negative eugenics, to the extent that that they knew how to. Preventing physically disabled, mentally disabled, diseased, etc people from reproducing is undeniably a form of negative eugenics, which they did enforce, so it would be erroneous to say that the Nazis didn&rsquo;t enforce scientifically-based eugenics at all. They did some negative eugenics, but they also did the opposite of what positive eugenics should be like.
</p>

<p>
Hitler supported racism, mass murder, and pseudo-science. What I am advocating for is <i>real</i> eugenics, i.e. policies that are backed by reasoning, scientific evidence, and non-partisanship.

<div id="outline-container-genetic-diversity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="genetic-diversity"><span class="section-number-2">24.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t eugenics decrease genetic diversity?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-genetic-diversity">
<p>
Yes in the sense that it would definitely decrease the frequency of genes that cause people to be dumber, more violent, less productive, etc, but that&rsquo;s exactly what we want. How could there possibly be any downsides to removing them from the gene pool? And what benefits would there be to keeping those genes within the gene pool?
</p>

<p>
Aside from that, under the solution that we&rsquo;re proposing, the goal of eugenics wouldn&rsquo;t be to increase or decrease genetic diversity. Contrary to this question, eugenics could actually increase genetic diversity if there were desirable rare genes that got selected for.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-increasing-genetic-diversity" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="increasing-genetic-diversity"><span class="section-number-3">24.1.</span> Eugenics As A Means To Increase Genetic Diversity, Rather Than To Reduce It</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-increasing-genetic-diversity">
<p>
So the strongest argument <b>against</b> eugenics might be that it reduces genetic diversity, but what if a eugenics policy merely only aims to alter the proportions to which certain genes and alleles exist within the population, not to completely eliminate one gene in favor of another? For instance, if two hypothetical genes A and B exist in a population at percentages 80% and 20% respectively, what if the goal was to cause those genes to exist at 50% each? As another example, it is known that most humans have trichromatic vision and that tetrachromatic vision only exists in very, very few humans, perhaps only women exclusively. If a eugenics or genetic engineering policy aimed to increase the percentage of people with tetrachromatic vision in the population, then this would be another example of eugenics leading to an increase in genetic diversity, and one that seems like it should be very favorable.
</p>

<p>
Going even further, if the goal of a eugenics policy was to <b>increase</b> genetic diversity rather than to <b>decrease</b> it, this would lead to some very interesting things to ponder about. For one thing, the strongest argument against eugenics that it would decrease genetic diversity would not apply.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, a eugenics policy might aim to modify the genetic composition to be more uneven, like modifying genes A and B to exist from 50% each to percentage ratios like 70/30, 80/20, or even 90/10, but not to 100/0% where one of the genes would be completely eliminated from the population.
</p>

<p>
It could potentially be very beneficial for society to breed people with type-O blood (the universal blood donor) that have a strong sense for altruism or wanting to help people that they are very likely to donate lots and lots of blood to ensure a stable supply for society.
</p>

<p>
For that matter, the same could be even more easily said for the people who possess that extremely rare blood type that is even more beneficial than type-O blood. In Australia, there is someone whose donated blood has been used to develop some medication that has saved the lives of an estimated ~2 million people.

This would also balance out the sexual market.

If genetic engineering becomes popular and successful, it&rsquo;s possible that any discussion about requiring positive and/or negative eugenics prior to having children could become an outdated idea.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anybody who wants children could have children, as long as they are genetically improved.</li>
<li>Eugenics has a lot of stigma since it is associated with Nazism and racism, but eugenics doesn&rsquo;t have to be racist. For that matter, eugenics wouldn&rsquo;t be discussed at all if genetic engineering became a social norm.</li>
<li>What would be the consequences on society if a new generation of humans were genetically engineered to be better in every way possible?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Genetic engineering could do a number of things to improve humans:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Add ability to automatically produce their own vitamin C.</li>
<li>Remove all wisdom teeth</li>
<li>i</li>
</ul>

<p>
Another mechanism of biological evolution is epigenetics, or changes not to the DNA sequence itself, but rather the way it is expressed.
