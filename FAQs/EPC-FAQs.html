<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-eugenics-in-modern-society">
<p>
It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that in several ways, there is already popular support for some widely practiced and commonly accepted forms of Eugenics in modern society. Those instances just aren&rsquo;t called Eugenics when they occur. Some examples include: aborting fetuses that have severe birth defects, outlawing incest between close relatives, <a href="https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/05/eugenics-ready/">replacing defective mitochondrial DNA in some children conceived via IVF</a>, and how some sperm and egg banks prohibit donations from people who have ADHD, ASD, or do not meet certain height requirements. I support all those instances of eugenics, except for the last one, which I explain here: <a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">Why Laissez-Faire Eugenics is the best</a>.

<h2 id="what-we-want"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> What We Are Advocating For</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-we-want">
<p>
In order to prevent war, disease, and famine, there must be a maximum population limit enforced for the country&rsquo;s total number of citizens. In order to enforce that population limit, anybody who wants to have children must acquire a Reproduction License for each child that they want to have. Everybody else who is unauthorized to have (more) children must have mandatory contraception, since that is the only way to ensure that people do not create legally unauthorized offspring.

<div id="outline-container-why-control-reproduction" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="why-control-reproduction"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Why do you want to control Reproduction?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-control-reproduction">
<p>
If we don&rsquo;t regulate reproduction, then we are destined to face overpopulation, and potentially <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html?view=classic">some combination of war and famine</a>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the social control of reproduction is not a new idea. It is a very old and almost universal practice. In the past, reproduction was controlled by the institution of marriage. Almost every society had some form of marriage that regulated human sexual behavior. Sex outside marriage was not allowed. We abandoned the traditional control of reproduction without understanding its function or the consequences of abandoning it. We are now seeing the consequences (and paying the costs) of abandoning marriage. It is time to replace marriage with a modern form of reproduction control.

<h2 id="why-implement-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Why do you want to implement Eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-implement-eugenics">
<p>
For one thing, we live in a time where there is great evolutionary mismatch between the people living in society, and the modern environment that we humans have created. Biological evolution is slower than cultural evolution and humans evolve more slowly than pathogens.
</p>

<p>
One of the strongest, arguments in favor of eugenics is how evolution is <i>not</i> guided by a human brain. Again, it must be stated and emphasized that the humans that did get to pass their genes onto the next generation only had to be <i>smart enough</i> to build shelter, hunt and gather food/water, and raise healthy children for the next generation. It could be argued that evolution simply hasn&rsquo;t gone far enough in selecting more intelligent humans.

Even worse, if modern civilization collapses, it will probably never recover since fossil fuels that powered it will already be all used up, and the necessary energy won&rsquo;t exist anymore to restart industrial civilization.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-overpopulation-and-eugenics">
<p>
When a population reaches the carrying capacity of its environment, competition and eugenic selection occur in order to select the organisms that are the most reproductively successful in the scarce resources environment.
</p>

<p>
By removing the selectionary pressures on humanity and limitations that have traditionally limited the carrying capacity of the human population, not only does this cause dysgenics from the removal of said selectionary pressures, but it also causes overpopulation. That said, if we achieved legally-enforced population control for humanity, then we would be placing artificial selectionary pressures that will increase the eugenic quality of the human population, that would otherwise never occur.
</p>

<p>
If someone is going to be in favor of population control, ought to be in favor of bottom-up eugenics as well (top-down eugenics would fail the same reason why command economies fail). Many people today are against eugenics because it would require restricting some people from having children, but population control does the same thing and population control will be necessary in order to prevent catastrophic disasters from happening in the future, so this is not a good argument against eugenics.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-licenses-and-elderly">
<p>
No, because this misunderstands what the reproduction licenses are for. They are not a license for a person to live, they are a license for a married couple to have a child in one if they meet <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">the requirements</a>. Since only a finite maximum number of children can be born within each year, this would mean that the total population of the country would have very little variation and would stay roughly constant for many years or decades, assuming that the government doesn&rsquo;t pass a law to change the maximum population birth rate.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-georgist-reasoning-and-elderly">
<p>
Some Georgists might object that if we limit the number of people who can be born each year on the basis that it is economic land (every married couple needs a license for each child that they have), then everybody also needs a license to live since the country has a legal maximum population size, and therefore only a finite number of people can live in the country at a time. But this does not follow because under the EPC system that we are proposing, there would be some amount of buffer room between the legal maximum population limit and the carrying capacity of the environment to avoid overpopulation, so if the carrying capacity dropped during an emergency, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a need to decide who gets to live and who doesn&rsquo;t, nor would it be necessary to kill off the most elderly members of the society in the event of an overpopulation crisis (when the population is dangerously higher than the carrying capacity).

<div id="outline-container-how-to-enforce-EPC" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="how-to-enforce-EPC"><span class="section-number-2">11.</span> How would you enforce an EPC system with Reproduction Licenses?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-how-to-enforce-EPC">
<p>
The enforcement of the EPC system will depend on how <a href="#not-authoritarian">&ldquo;authoritarian&rdquo;</a> the government has to be in order to enforce the Law. If it&rsquo;s necessary, mandatory regular testing will be performed on all fertile women to ensure that a form of legally-approved birth control is being used 24/7, unless the citizen has a reproduction license to authorize a pregnancy. This testing would be done as often as necessary in order to ensure compliance with the law, whether that be every few months, monthly, or whatever timeframe is necessary in order to enforce the law. This may seem draconian, but the only way to ensure an EPC system is with regular birth control and regular inspections, otherwise there will always be the possibility that someone tries to have unauthorized offspring without the government&rsquo;s approval in an attempt to cheat the system. I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about this, and there is no other way to do it.
</p>

<p>
But if someone does happen to intentionally or accidentally conceive a child, and they refuse to buy a reproduction license to pay for the child&rsquo;s existence, then the embryo/fetus will have to be aborted as soon as possible. This eliminates the need to euthanize children who have already been born.
</p>

<p>
Any pregnancy that results from a rape must be aborted immediately. The rapist would automatically be disqualified from being able to obtain a reproduction license since rape is a felony, as is conceiving children without meeting <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">the reproduction license requirements</a>. Evolutionary Reasoning gives a really good reason to make it legal to abort fetuses that resulted from rape, since not aborting said fetuses would select for genes that make people more likely to rape.
</p>

<p>
If it is necessary, then regular pregnancy tests will be done on all women who menstruate. If these tests are performed every 1-3 months (depending on what works best), fees could be charged on women or couples who wait too long to notify the government and have an abortion, and they can be charged by the number of days spent waiting if this is determined to be best. Permanently sterilized women would not have to undergo these regular inspections, unless the government determines that it&rsquo;s necessary in order to enforce the Law.
</p>

<p>
Anybody who manages to conceive and give birth to a child without a reproduction license by evading the mandatory birth control testing and evading the possibly necessary pregnancy testing will face the dilemma of having to hide their illegally born child from the government and anybody who might report them to the government, which will be extremely difficult. Any parent who has an unauthorized child can&rsquo;t hide them forever. They will be found <i>eventually</i>. Illegally conceived children would have to be socially excluded from society, would have no access to public education or healthcare systems (lest they be seen and forced to identify themselves). The parent would have to severely hamper the child&rsquo;s social skills and intellectual development, and this would simply be too challenging and undesirable for anybody who dares to break the Law to make it worth doing. The easier thing for people to do would be to cooperate with society and have children by legal means only, including making the due payments for the cost of reproduction licenses at the time of conception.
</p>

<p>
If it proves to be effective and necessary for enforcing the Law, the government could even have bounty programs where people are rewarded for reporting felons who managed to have an unauthorized child without a reproduction license. If it proves to be socially undesirable for the government to administer regular birth control compliance tests and a bounty reporting system for unlicensed children proves to be more effective instead, then perhaps the bounty system would become the preferred way of ensuring that EPC is enforced.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-hidden-unauthorized-children" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="hidden-unauthorized-children"><span class="section-number-3">11.1.</span> But what if a couple manages to hide unauthorized children from the state until the children are a few years old?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-hidden-unauthorized-children">
<p>
First off, it is extremely unlikely that this would ever happen since there are three ridiculously difficult obstacles that would have to be passed in order for this happen:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The couple would have to figure out how to evade the mandatory birth control compliance tests that would be administered on a monthly basis.</li>
<li>The couple would have to figure out how to evade pregnancy tests.</li>
<li>The couple would have to figure out how to hide a child from not just government, but also society if a bounty system is put in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This question underestimates just how difficult it would be to cheat the system. Few people would ever bother trying to do this anyway since the easier option to choose to obey the <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">the legal requirements</a> and pay the reproduction tax for having children. And even if someone did cheat the system against all odds by illegally giving birth to an unauthorized child without a reproduction license, they would be committing a felony. Anybody who violates the EPC policy will be permanently sterilized and forbidden from ever buying a reproduction license, so that is a strong incentive for people to just follow the rules.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, it has already been said that how &ldquo;authoritarian&rdquo; the government would have to be in order to enforce the EPC system would depend on how compliant and cooperative the populace is. The state can be as draconian and &ldquo;authoritarian&rdquo; as it needs to be to enforce this policy. Society is all about cooperation. If you&rsquo;re not going to cooperate with society, then you lose your right to exist within the society.
</p>

<p>
Over time, the EPC system might even have the positive effect of selecting for a more cooperative, law-abiding population of citizens, potentially to the point where testing measures for birth control and possibly pregnancy are unnecessary.

<div id="outline-container-fate-of-unauthorized-children" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="fate-of-unauthorized-children"><span class="section-number-4">11.1.1.</span> If unauthorized children were born, what will happen to them?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-fate-of-unauthorized-children">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve already explained that it is extremely unlikely that this would ever happen. But if it did happen, and society determines that it is too brutal to euthanize the infants or toddlers, then they could be allowed to live. But the unlicensed child will be sterilized in order to prevent the transmission of their genes, and the parents will be forced to repay society for the incurred costs of that child&rsquo;s existence. This could be done by fining the parents at a fee that is 50% higher than the cost of a reproduction license. If they are unable to pay that, then they will be placed in a debtor&rsquo;s prison until they pay off their debt to society. The felony will be placed on their public record, and any other <a href="../civilization.html#legal-penalties">legal penalties that they may have to face</a> will be enforced.
</p>


<p>
Since people who try to have children illegally would only be able to have just one child before they get caught, they would be reproducing below replacement fertility rates, so selective pressures would be placed against genes that cause people to cheat until they finally disappear or become extremely uncommon.

<div id="outline-container-difficulty-of-enforcement" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="difficulty-of-enforcement"><span class="section-number-3">11.2.</span> Will EPC be too difficult to enforce?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-difficulty-of-enforcement">
<p>
No. It would be easier than enforcing many current laws, including traffic regulations and the law against murder. The law against murder is difficult to enforce because it is often difficult to identify murderers. Some murders go unsolved. No one uses this as an argument that murder should be legal. It is much easier to identify people who have unlicensed children than it currently is to identify murderers. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to conceal a child. <i>They will be found eventually.</i> If bounty programs are necessary in order to find and report unlicensed children, then so be it.

<div id="outline-container-not-authoritarian" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="not-authoritarian"><span class="section-number-2">12.</span> Would EPC be horribly authoritarian?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-authoritarian">
<p>
No. It would be no more authoritarian than limiting the freedom to drive or the freedom to kill other people. Reproduction has serious consequences that can be harmful to others, and so the imposition of social constraints on reproduction is justified for the same reason that social constraints on other behaviors are justified. Reproduction licenses are the simplest, most practical, and least authoritarian solution to save the world from the war and famine that will result from overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
Also, licenses are already required to adopt children, so it is logically inconsistent to not also require licenses for people to have biological children.
</p>

<p>
Another key to limiting the &ldquo;authoritarianism&rdquo; of EPC is that regular testing for enforcing the birth control laws would reduce the need for legally-mandated abortions. The births of unauthorized children would be <i>extremely rare</i>, but if that did happen, there are <a href="#fate-of-unauthorized-children">ways to deal with that reasonably</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-human-rights">
<p>
For those who believe in human rights, there are plenty of good reasons why EPC would protect human rights, not violate them. i
</p>

<p>
A child that cannot be supported by its parents is either a burden on the rest of society (which harms other members of society), or it will be harmed by neglect. Uncontrolled reproduction inflicts harm on others, so there is a clear ethical basis for socially controlling reproduction.
</p>

<p>
EPC would select against any genetic causes of criminal behavior, thus offering further protection of human rights.
</p>

<p>
In the previous section, it was explained that when a population reaches its carrying capacity, <a href="#life-is-zero-sum">Life becomes a zero-sum game where every existing organism can only exist at the cost of another</a>. If we wish to avoid the famine, war, and disease that will inevitably be caused by overpopulation, then it is necessary for us to enforce reasonable population control measures, since modern society has removed the selectionary pressures on the human genome that were historically important for regulating human populations.
</p>

<p>
It is also extremely important to emphasize here that what&rsquo;s at stake here is whether modern technological society thrives or permanently collapses forever. For anybody who values humanity having a prosperous, thriving future for humanity, what could be more important than that? If Industrial Society does collapse, there&rsquo;s a strong possibility that it will never recover and that will be it. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AoDTlbRRkw">&ldquo;Collapse is Forever&rdquo;</a>, Blithering Genius explains that if modern civilization collapses, the fossil fuels that powered it will already be all used up, hence the necessary energy won&rsquo;t exist anymore to restart it.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-laissez-faire-is-best">
<p>
Several reasons. [elaborate]
</p>

<p>
This <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">reasonable set of requirements</a> would create a healthy population with plenty of desirable genetic diversity, aside from traits that make people prone to be less cooperative, less intelligent, less productive, more violent, etc. We want our population to have enough genetic diversity so that an unpredictable change to the environmental circumstances will ensure that our population will be able to adapt to the changing circumstances.
</p>

<p>
These requirements would eventually cause the ability to pay the Reproduction Tax to become the primary selectionary pressure since the demand for reproduction licenses would gradually increase over time while the supply stays the same, unless the carrying capacity rises and <a href="#carrying-capacity">the government authorizes an increase in the number of reproduction licenses</a>, since we already have a sizable populace who is capable of meeting the other requirements. The Reproduction Tax is a logical consequence of <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">sound economic reasoning and population dynamics</a>. It also selects for productivity, which in turn selects for intelligence and pragmatism.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-not-select-for-IQ">
<p>
Because selecting for IQ is not a good basis for eugenics. Whatever gets prioritized by natural selection (or eugenics) comes at the cost of decreasing other potentially desirable traits. In this case, selecting only for IQ might make the population more intelligent, but it wouldn&rsquo;t select for the ability to rear children nor for physical fitness. The end result would be a really smart population that isn&rsquo;t capable of producing descendants, in which case a eugenics system that only selects for IQ would be its own worst enemy. The birth rates would plummet to being well below replacement fertility for enough generations to the point where the society would be extremely vulnerable to attacks from foreign invaders.

<p>
Creating selectionary pressures in favor of more productive people will yield a more productive society.

<p>
One of the reasons for this is that the psychological need to go through the <a href="../misc/industrial-society-and-its-future-manifesto.html#power-process">Power Process</a> strongly incentivizes many people (myself included) to not steal things that we desire or cheat/slack off on the job in life.

<p>
Georgist reasoning compliments the population control scheme that we want to implement extremely well, and not by coincidence if we expand the notion of &ldquo;natural resources&rdquo; to also include the finite supply of organisms that can exist within a finite environment. Since life is a zero-sum competition game for energy when a population reaches its carrying capacity, anybody who has children in such an environment would be doing so at the cost of preventing other people to have children as well. This is very similar to how anybody who occupies a parcel of land prevents other people from using that parcel.

<p>
We&rsquo;ve established in the previous question how overpopulation is connected to eugenics, and now we&rsquo;ve established how georgism is connected to regulating overpopulation.

<div id="outline-container-reproduction-tax-conditions" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="reproduction-tax-conditions"><span class="section-number-3">16.2.</span> Under what conditions would the Reproduction Tax not be applied?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-reproduction-tax-conditions">
<p>
The conditions are easy to understand, provided that you have an understanding of both Georgism <i>and</i> population dynamics.
</p>

<p>
If EPC was enacted in a country, and the number of people who apply for reproduction licenses is smaller than the number of babies that can be born within that year, then there would be no tax on reproduction. This is just like how there is no need to tax land or natural resources in order to solve the tragedy of the commons with regards to scarce resources if there is plenty of valuable land for everybody.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, since populations naturally reproduce up to the carrying capacities of their environments when the species is well-adapted to its environment, then the population would spend most of its time in an Evolutionarily Stable State (ESS), so there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need to worry about whether or not the population will have enough children up to the Legal Maximum Population Limit. But in the event that the population is significantly lower than the carrying capacity, then <a href="#reproduction-tax-conditions">there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need to tax reproduction at all</a>. Since the population of the EPC country would spend most of its time the legally maximum population limit with very fluctuation from one year to the next, the population size would be very constant for many years or decades, assuming that the government doesn&rsquo;t pass a law to change the maximum population birth rate, and no unexpected events like war occur.

<div id="outline-container-banning-female-infanticide" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="banning-female-infanticide"><span class="section-number-2">17.</span> Would regulating reproduction cause female infanticide in countries like China and India?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-banning-female-infanticide">
<p>
No, because we can assume that any government that has the power to enforce EPC would also have the authority to enforce a law that bans female infanticide. In the interest of ensuring an equalized sex ratio for the country&rsquo;s population, female infanticide will be outlawed, unless it can be proven that the fetus/infant had severe birth defects, a severe genetic disease, etc. If it married couples were tempted to kill their female children because they wanted a son instead, then the government could simply create a law that forbids that married couple from ever possessing another reproduction license and the couple would not get a refund, which would guarantee an equalized demographic sex ratio. All parents must accept the sex of the child that they give birth to, or else they will be forbidden from having any children at all.
</p>

<p>
Since a married couple would have to have a reproduction license <i>before</i> they conceive a child in the womb, the government could ensure that that the child will be born by contractually requiring the prospective parents to carry the child until birth, regardless of the sex of the fetus. This would prevent couples from trying to abort female fetuses while they are still in the womb. If the child was aborted for any reason, then the reason has to be documented. If the reason for the abortion was merely because the fetus was female, then the couple would permanently lose their reproductive rights and would not get a refund.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, since shifting to a relatively low fertility country (in comparison to historical trends) would necessitate that women would be spending more time doing other things besides just raising children, that should cause female children to be perceived as being more valuable in countries where female infanticide is a cultural problem, which would further help to reduce the problem altogether.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if a couple of parents only had daughters born, but they still wanted a son, then they can still have a son as long as they buy another reproduction license and they happen to give birth to a son. Generally speaking however, creating artificial barriers to reproduction would make having children of higher social status because having children would become harder to achieve. This is a good thing because it would cause parents to value their children more, regardless of whatever sex they children may be born as.

That&rsquo;s a foolish objection (and an Appeal to Nature Fallacy?). What is the natural order of things? Until recently, most children died young. Now, with modern civilization (based on fossil fuels) we allow most children to live to adulthood. If eugenics violates the natural order then so does modern civilization. And without eugenics modern civilization is unsustainable. Eugenic population control is needed to balance the effects of modern prosperity on the human population. We could use eugenic population control to create a new &ldquo;natural order&rdquo; of sustainable prosperity. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we? Nature will not strike us down for using eugenics. In fact, the opposite is true. Nature will eventually destroy our civilization if we don&rsquo;t regulate our population eugenically.

<p>
Eugenics ≠ Nazism. If anything, the Nazis failed to implement eugenics on a scientific/rational basis. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that blonde hair, blue eyes, white skin, and other &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; physical characteristics lead to higher intelligence. When it comes to intelligence, what matters is selecting for <i>mental</i> characteristics, not physical ones.
</p>

<p>
So from a scientific perspective, the Nazis did <i>not</i> advocate for policies that enforced positive eugenics. For someone who purportedly promoted positive eugenics, Hitler only did that in name only, and in fact accomplished the exact opposite of that. Instead of encouraging the reproduction of people who were scientifically proven to be more intelligent, physically-fit, etc than the average human, Hitler killed millions of people from one of the most influential ethnic groups in history relative to its size: the Jews. Given the Jews&rsquo; strong record of making scientific accomplishments, contributing to human progress, and acquiring positions of power, killing millions of them is the opposite of what someone should be doing if they want to promote positive eugenic traits like intelligence or physical fitness.

For someone who purportedly promoted positive eugenics, Hitler only did that in name only, and in fact accomplished the exact opposite of that. That&rsquo;s what the Nazis <b>said</b> they were doing, but what were they <b>actually</b> doing? Instead of breeding people who were scientifically proven to be more intelligent, physically-fit, etc than the average human, he killed millions of people from the most successful ethnic group in history: the Jews. Given the Jews&rsquo; strong record of making scientific accomplishments, contributing to human progress, and acquiring positions of power, killing millions of them is the opposite of what someone should be doing if they want to promote positive eugenic traits like intelligence or physical fitness.
</p>

<p>
Instead, the Nazis promoted racist, pseudo-scientific garbage, and used that as an excuse for killing some of the most productive members of society. I would like to very strongly emphasize to the fullest extent possible that Racism is <i>not</i> eugenics. The Nazis merely used eugenics as a cover justification for killing people during the Holocaust.
</p>

<p>
However, it can be clearly argued that the Nazis did promote negative eugenics, to the extent that that they knew how to. Preventing physically disabled, mentally disabled, diseased, etc people from reproducing is undeniably a form of negative eugenics, which they did enforce, so it would be erroneous to say that the Nazis didn&rsquo;t enforce scientifically-based eugenics at all. They did some negative eugenics, but they also did the opposite of what positive eugenics should be like.
</p>

<p>
Hitler supported racism, mass murder, and pseudo-science. What I am advocating for is <i>real</i> eugenics, i.e. policies that are backed by reasoning, scientific evidence, and non-partisanship.

No, understanding evolution and the human condition would rationally conclude a eugenostate, not an ethnostate.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ethnostate-as-eugenostate">
<p>
In theory, an ethnostate could also be a eugenostate, but in order to be both, it would have to have the requirements of an ethnostate, namely a loyal and homogeneous ethnic population with strict immigration requirements on not only eugenics, but also on the applicants&rsquo; ethnicities. If a eugenostate had to be an ethnostate as well, then that would make it harder for it to accomplish its goal of eugenics because it would have to deny applicants who are of a different race, even if they have eugenic qualities that would benefit the state&rsquo;s population.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-DNA-testings">
<p>
There are both good and bad consequences for requiring prospective parents to get DNA testings.
</p>

<p>
On one hand, it can be argued that anything that gets measured is also <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/">bound to be controlled by the government</a>.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it can be argued that it is anti-knowledge and anti-truth to insist that we shouldn&rsquo;t collect any statistics at all. &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t collect statistics on X&rdquo; = &ldquo;We should be deliberately ignorant about X&rdquo;. For instance, we would never have statistical evidence for confirming the truth about race realism if it was forbidden to collect statistics on how different races and immigrants perform regarding education, crime rates, income levels, etc. Deliberately not collecting statistics would be deliberately limiting our knowledge of reality. There are many benefits to DNA testing.

<div id="outline-container-genetic-diversity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="genetic-diversity"><span class="section-number-2">24.</span> Would eugenics decrease genetic diversity?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-genetic-diversity">
<p>
Yes in the sense that it would definitely decrease the frequency of genes that cause people to be dumber, more violent, less productive, etc, but that&rsquo;s exactly what we want. How could there possibly be any downsides to removing them from the gene pool? And what benefits would there be to keeping those genes within the gene pool?
</p>

<p>
Aside from that, under the solution that we&rsquo;re proposing, the goal of eugenics wouldn&rsquo;t be to increase or decrease genetic diversity. Contrary to this question, eugenics could actually increase genetic diversity if there were desirable rare genes that got selected for.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-no-unforeseen-consequences" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="no-unforeseen-consequences"><span class="section-number-3">24.1.</span> What if the reduction in genetic diversity causes unforeseen and unfavorable effects in the future?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-no-unforeseen-consequences">
<p>
How would that happen in the first place, if we are using laissez-faire eugenics, and are thus not selecting for any particular genes?

<div id="outline-container-increasing-genetic-diversity" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="increasing-genetic-diversity"><span class="section-number-3">24.2.</span> Eugenics As A Means To Increase Genetic Diversity, Rather Than To Reduce It</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-increasing-genetic-diversity">
<p>
So the strongest argument <b>against</b> eugenics might be that it reduces genetic diversity, but what if a eugenics policy merely only aims to alter the proportions to which certain genes and alleles exist within the population, not to completely eliminate one gene in favor of another? For instance, if two hypothetical genes A and B exist in a population at percentages 80% and 20% respectively, what if the goal was to cause those genes to exist at 50% each? As another example, it is known that most humans have trichromatic vision and that tetrachromatic vision only exists in very, very few humans, perhaps only women exclusively. If a eugenics or genetic engineering policy aimed to increase the percentage of people with tetrachromatic vision in the population, then this would be another example of eugenics leading to an increase in genetic diversity, and one that seems like it should be very favorable.
</p>

<p>
Going even further, if the goal of a eugenics policy was to <i>increase</i> genetic diversity rather than to <i>decrease</i> it, this would lead to some very interesting things to ponder about. For one thing, the strongest argument against eugenics that it would decrease genetic diversity would not apply.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, a eugenics policy might aim to modify the genetic composition to be more uneven, like modifying genes A and B to exist from 50% each to percentage ratios like 70/30, 80/20, or even 90/10, but not to 100/0% where one of the genes would be completely eliminated from the population.
</p>

<p>
It could potentially be very beneficial for society to breed people with type-O blood (the universal blood donor) that have a strong sense for altruism or wanting to help people that they are very likely to donate lots and lots of blood to ensure a stable supply for society.
</p>

<p>
For that matter, the same could be even more easily said for the people who possess that extremely rare blood type that is even more beneficial than type-O blood. In Australia, there is someone whose donated blood has been used to develop some medication that has saved the lives of an estimated ~2 million people.

But if they are going to be legal, then a separate type of reproduction license would have to be obtained for people who wan to donate their sperm or eggs.

<p>
Having children would become higher social status since the legal requirements and auction prices would make it harder to have children. When people see other people with lots of children, people will learn to associate having lots of children with higher social status, as things should be.
</p>

<p>
This would also balance out the sexual market. Since it would be illegal to have children without another parent who is legally contracted to help raise the child, there would be no more single mothers, who are highly undesirable for men to date for a number of reasons. This would increase the number of women for men to date.
</p>

Another factor that would balance out the sexual market is how women wouldn&rsquo;t be liberated from men anymore. The modern welfare state and culture of modernity have liberated women from men. [elaborate on this]
