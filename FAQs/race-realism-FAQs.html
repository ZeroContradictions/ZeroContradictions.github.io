<h2 id="what-is-race-realism"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> What is Race Realism?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-is-race-realism">
<p>
<b>Race Realism</b>: Race Realism is a subcategory of Biological Realism. Being a race realist means acknowledging that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Race is defined as &ldquo;a statistical cluster of genes&rdquo;, and</li>
<li>All the genes of the various races in the world occur at different statistical frequencies for each race due to all the different evolutionary and selectionary pressures that persisted in their ancestral environments for many thousands of years, and</li>
<li>Race is often a categorization scheme for human beings based on phenotypic similarity.</li>
</ol>
<p>
That&rsquo;s it. But you have to understand what a &ldquo;statistical cluster&rdquo; is, and what that means with regards to race and genetics, as well as understanding that racial differences are continuous, not discrete like the distinction between species. [Race Realism] != [Racism].

<h2 id="social-construct"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Isn&rsquo;t Race just a social construct?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-social-construct">
<p>
Yes, but that does not constitute an argument against race realism. Rather, it is a false dichotomy: the social construct of beauty does not mean that humans look identical and that their appearance is only a product of perception. Likewise, race is a social construct built on top of a biological reality.
</p>

<p>
Framing race as nothing more than a social construct ignores that race is also a statistical cluster of genes. There are meaningful ways to categorize people into racial groups, and it is valid to inquire into the differences between different human population groups. There are real differences, and that does have implications for social policy and understanding societal outcomes.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-pseuodo-science">
<p>
No, and this question assumes that Academia can be trusted, even though there are multiple reasons why Academia cannot be trusted:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ideological Bias</li>
<li>Perverse Incentives</li>
<li>Social Circularity</li>
<li>Naive/Fake Empiricism</li>
<li>Statistical Manipulation and p-Hacking</li>

No, if there are differences between races, then Occam&rsquo;s Razor concludes that racial differences are the simplest explanation for racial disparities and achievement gaps between races.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-crime-rates-realist-explanation">
<p>
The Americas had a lower population because they didn&rsquo;t have agriculture or livestock to create as large of a food supply compared to Europeans and East Asians. This lower food supply lead to a lower population in the Americas. The lower food supply and the competition for food lead to a nomadic lifestyle and occasional tribal warfare, hence why the Americas were sparsely populated in comparison to Europe and East Asia. Due to this sparse population density and geographical barriers, this also means that there also may have been some tribes that never got close to other tribes, and thus didn&rsquo;t evolved to be as aggressive as other Native American ethnicities.
</p>

<p>
It is known that there are only three main factors that have historically prevented human populations from growing to infinity: 1. war, 2. disease, and 3. famine. We can rule out disease from being the primary or secondary limiting factor of population growth in the Pre-Columbian Americas since the Amerindians had very little genetic immunity to Old World diseases, and also since it&rsquo;s well-documented that the New World had fewer diseases than the Old World, besides syphilis. The lack of food was thus the primary cause limiting Native American populations, while tribal warfare was the secondary cause. Whereas for Europeans, disease was usually the primary or secondary cause of premature death before the Industrial Revolution.
</p>

<p>
Since tribal warfare was a greater cause of death in the Americas than Europe or East Asia, this means that Native Americans faced greater selectionary pressures in favor of genes that are associated with aggression and violence, on average. While it is true that Europeans also faced tribal warfare that limited their populations in their pre-industrial societies, it was on a lesser scale than what occurred in the Americas because European populations were limited more often by diseases instead due to their domestication of livestock, combined with their higher population densities. This means that Europeans faced greater selectionary pressures in favor of immunity against diseases since they had more diseases in their ancestral environments, and relatively lower selectionary pressures in favor of genes that are associated with violence and aggression, compared to Sub-Saharan Africans and Native Americans. This explains why African Americans and Native Americans have higher crime rates than Europeans, on average. Environmental factors are probably also a contributing factor as well, but they have a more minor contribution to the disparity in the crime rates statistics.

<p>
The rates of violent crime have been falling since the mid-1990s, in spite of a surge in single parenthood during the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s. However, the theory that single parenthood causes criminality would predict the opposite, as it would predict an increase in violent crime following the increase in single parenthood by about 20 years. While this doesn&rsquo;t prove that single parenthood has no effect on crime rates, it&rsquo;s counter-evidence that needs to be considered, along with all the best explanations why crime rates fell during the 90s and onward.
</p>

<p>
Instead of single-parent households causing higher crime rates, it could also be the case that people who grew up in single-parent / fatherless households are simply more likely to be less responsible and commit more crime because their parents&rsquo; genes were less responsible in the first place. Correlation does not imply causation, but genetic factors shouldn&rsquo;t be ruled out in favor of environmental factors just because the former is a more taboo explanation. A child with good genes would probably perform decently well even without a father present, although they would obviously be better with a father in all cases.

Yes for the most part, but this does not debunk race realism. Once again, a race is a statistical cluster of genes. That means that there can be statistical outliers to any generalized claim made about a race(s). Relatively high-IQ people can come from low-IQ races, and relatively low-IQ people can come from high-IQ races, but when this happens, those people are the statistical outliers of their respective races. Race realism is the recognition of statistical tendencies that are caused by historical evolutionary patterns, not dogmatic judgments.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the possibility that statistical outliers may exist within a data set is precisely the reason why racism is irrational. Even if race A has consistently lower crime rates and consistently higher average IQs than race B, it would be dangerous to assume that that would be the case for <i>every single person</i> belonging to race A, and equally wrong to assume that <i>every single person</i> belonging to race B is going to be less intelligent or more likely to commit crimes that every single person from race A. The way how individuals should be treated should always be based on merit, not congenital demographic properties.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-starting-tabula-rasa">
<p>
No. Even though everybody might be born knowing virtually nothing (see: <a href="../epistemology/tabula-rasa-eval.html">Evaluating Tabula Rasa</a>), this does not prove that all individuals have equal intellectual ability because it ignores that some races are better at learning than others. Every expert was a beginner at some point, but some people (and some races, on average) are better at becoming experts and intellectuals than others.

<p>
The short answer is: No.
</p>

<p>
I for one, am a race realist who believes that people should be judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. The next few subsections elaborate on this and why there is nothing contradictory about being a race realist and non-racist.

<h3 id="org873898d"><span class="section-number-3">10.1.</span> Race realism does not imply racism.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-1">
<p>
There are many race realists who are not racist (including myself), especially if they are in favor of a eugenostate instead of an ethnostate. A Eugenostate would treat all races equally under the law, but there would be competition regarding who is authorized to reproduce who is forbidden. So while it would be inevitable that some races would be more reproductively successful than others under a eugenostate, there would be legal limitations on people from any race from being able to have children. Eugenostates value equal opportunities, not equality of outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Non-racist race-realists do not advocate that some races be given greater legal privileges than other races. We believe that all people from any race should be entitled to the same legal rights as anyone else. Racism is for the most part and in most cases, a form of irrational discrimination.

<p>
Race Realism is about acknowledging that every race has genes that made them more reproductively successful in their ancestral environments. But now that we live in modernity, the statistical evidence makes it abundantly clear that some races are better adapted to modernity than others (on average).

These examples are meant to show that race is far far more than just a social construction.

This is an incomplete list of examples:

<h2 id="racists"><span class="section-number-2">12.</span> If race realists don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be racist, then why are so many of them racist?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-racists">
<p>
The first half of the answer to this question has to do with memetics and how ideologies evolve over time. As explained in the essay, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-rise-and-fall-of-alt-right.html?view=classic">The Rise and Fall of the Alt-Right</a>, the Alt-Right started out as an intellectual movement, but then it degenerated into a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html?view=classic">Utopian Ideology</a> that got dumber and dumber since ideologies need to tap into human emotions in order to propagate most effectively. Since the ideology started spreading via emotions instead of reason, this caused all sorts of purity spiraling where the leaders and members of the movement started promoting more extremist and less rational ideas in an attempt to claim status over other members of the movement. <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html?view=classic">This other post &ldquo;Status Pyramid Schemes&rdquo;</a> talks more about how that process and the evolution of memetic ideologies works in general.
</p>

<p>
Race realists like myself don&rsquo;t want a movement that is driven by emotions and deplorable claims to status. We want an ideology that is supported by reason and scientific evidence. We do have some ideas about how to start a philosophical movement that includes race realism without devolving into a virtue-signaling contest, but that will be a post for another time.
</p>

<p>
The second reason why so many race realists tend to be racist is that racist people are more likely to support the idea of race realism, except that they don&rsquo;t have the intellectual or the bio-evolutionary understanding for the tenants of race realism. I <i>refuse</i> to associate with those kinds of people since they are anti-intellectual, believe in unequal rights, and do not have similar goals.

<div id="outline-container-race-mixing" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="race-mixing"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> Aren&rsquo;t all race realists against race-mixing?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-race-mixing">
<p>
No. I have mentioned on this page that I am mixed-race. It is true that most racists are against race-mixing to some degree, but as I have already written in this FAQ, racism is not the same thing as race realism. Some race realists are against race-mixing (e.g. Payton S. Gendron, the 2022 Buffalo shooter), but that is mainly because they don&rsquo;t understand that race-mixing is inevitable.
</p>

<p>
In fact, if you go back far enough in history, everybody living today is &ldquo;mixed-race&rdquo; in a sense, and race-mixing was an important part of human evolution. Modern humans were formed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbreeding_between_archaic_and_modern_humans">interbreeding between homo sapiens, neanderthals, and denisovans</a>, to varying degrees for all the races of the world. And that doesn&rsquo;t even include all the races that have mixed, merged, split, appeared, or disappeared since then for all kinds of complicated historical and geographical reasons.

<h2 id="great-replacement"><span class="section-number-2">16.</span> Isn&rsquo;t The Great Replacement Of White People Just A Myth?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-great-replacement">
<p>
No, not at all. The people who are claiming that the Great Replacement Theory is just a myth are following the typical leftist tactic of denying that something bad is happening, but if it is happening, then it&rsquo;s actually a good thing.
</p>

<p>
Statistics consistently show that countries with historically European populations are becoming less and less European. This trend has been happening for decades. And people can pretend that this isn&rsquo;t a problem or that it won&rsquo;t lead to the perishing of white people all they want, but it is undeniable that if the trend continues for several decades, white people will be replaced by other races by and large, unless something happens to reverse the trend and increase the fertility levels of white people.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that we should do to prevent the Great Replacement is to tighten immigration into Western Countries. We already have limited resources, so there is no reason to allow more than a trickle of useful immigrants into the West.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://eternalanglo.com/">Eternal Anglo</a> is a good data analytics blog that covers the fertility rates of different races in different countries.
