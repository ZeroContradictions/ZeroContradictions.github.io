<b>Race Realism</b>: Race Realism is a subcategory of Biological Realism. Being a race realist means acknowledging that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Race is defined as &ldquo;a statistical cluster of genes&rdquo;, and</li>
<li>All the genes of the various races in the world occur at different statistical frequencies for each race due to all the different evolutionary and selectionary pressures that persisted in their ancestral environments for many thousands of years, and</li>
<li>Race is often a categorization scheme for human beings based on phenotypic similarity.</li>
</ol>
<p>
That&rsquo;s it. But you have to understand what a &ldquo;statistical cluster&rdquo; is, and what that means with regards to race and genetics, as well as understanding that racial differences are continuous, not discrete like the distinction between species. [Race Realism] != [Racism].

<h2 id="orgacd8e7a"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Isn&rsquo;t Race just a social construct?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Yes, but that does not constitute an argument against race realism. Rather, it is a false dichotomy: the social construct of beauty does not mean that humans look identical and that their appearance is only a product of perception. Likewise, race is a social construct built on top of a biological reality.
</p>

<p>
Framing race as nothing more than a social construct ignores that race is also a statistical cluster of genes. There are meaningful ways to categorize people into racial groups, and it is valid to inquire into the differences between different human population groups. There are real differences, and that does have implications for social policy and understanding societal outcomes.

No, and this question assumes that Academia can be trusted, even though there are multiple reasons why Academia cannot be trusted:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ideological Bias</li>

<li>Social Circularity</li>

<h2 id="org3778bab"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Isn&rsquo;t Race Realism Anti-Scientific?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
No. If anything, the overwhelming amount of statistical evidence proves that not all races are created equally in terms of their abilities and, accomplishments, and actions.
</p>

<h3 id="org7c9418a"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> The Contradiction In Acknowledging Sex Realism, But Not Race Realism</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Leftists: The differing crime rates between men and women is best explained by the fact that men and women have different genetics. Men are genetically defined as humans with a Y sex chromosome, whereas the genetic definition of a woman is a human with no Y chromosomes. It is also a known fact that men evolved to be more violent than women due to their different genetics, so there are no surprises here.
</p>

<p>
Leftists: The differing crime rates between different races cannot be explained by their differing genetics, even though the races all have different genetics from each other by the definition of &ldquo;race&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s also ignore the fact that the difference in crime rates between whites and blacks is proportionally larger than the difference between women and men (for which genetics is the best explanation).
</p>

<p>
Pick one. You can NOT be logically consistent if you pick <b>both</b> of these.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line here is that race realism is a fact of reality that is extensively supported by all the statistics we have available (education levels, income levels, crime levels, unique genetic traits, etc). Study after study has verified that literally all of these things be influenced by genetics. So if the definition of a &ldquo;race&rdquo; is a statistical cluster of genetic traits, then Occam&rsquo;s Razor concludes that different races will obviously have different intelligence levels, crime rates, and productivity levels.

<p>
No, if there are differences between races, then Occam&rsquo;s Razor concludes that racial differences are the simplest explanation for racial disparities and achievement gaps between races.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
No. Even though everybody might be born knowing virtually nothing (see: <a href="../epistemology/evaluating-tabula-rasa.html">Evaluating Tabula Rasa</a>), this does not prove that all individuals have equal intellectual ability because it ignores that some races are better at learning than others. Every expert was a beginner at some point, but some people (and some races, on average) are better at becoming experts and intellectuals than others.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
The short answer is: No.
</p>

<p>
I for one, am a race realist who believes that people should be judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. The next few subsections elaborate on this and why there is nothing contradictory about being a race realist and non-racist.

<h3 id="orgf44a653"><span class="section-number-3">8.1.</span> Race realism does not imply racism.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-1">
<p>
There are many race realists who are not racist (including myself), especially if they are in favor of a eugenostate instead of an ethnostate. A Eugenostate would treat all races equally under the law, but there would be competition regarding who is authorized to reproduce who is forbidden. So while it would be inevitable that some races would be more reproductively successful than others under a eugenostate, there would be legal limitations on people from any race from being able to have children. Eugenostates value equal opportunities, not equality of outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Non-racist race-realists do not advocate that some races be given greater legal privileges than other races. We believe that all people from any race should be entitled to the same legal rights as anyone else. Racism is for the most part and in most cases, a form of irrational discrimination.

<h3 id="org477d967"><span class="section-number-3">8.2.</span> Race realism does not imply white supremacy.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-2">
<p>
In fact, I (ZeroContradictions, the author of this blog) am half Western-European and half East-Asian. I am certainly not a white supremacist since I am mixed-race, as is most of my entire family since both of my parents, all my siblings, and all of my aunts and uncles are also hapas.
</p>

<p>
Race Realism is about acknowledging that every race has genes that made them more reproductively successful in their ancestral environments. But now that we live in modernity, the statistical evidence makes it abundantly clear that some races are better adapted to modernity than others (on average).

<p>
Race Realism is a scientific position that is backed by empirical evidence and statistics. On the other hand, the Nazis were racists and they backed their beliefs up with propaganda and pseudoscience. The Nazis did not understand what &ldquo;race&rdquo; actually is (a statistical cluster of genes). i

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
The first half of the answer to this question has to do with memetics and how ideologies evolve over time. As explained in the essay, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-rise-and-fall-of-alt-right.html?view=classic">The Rise and Fall of the Alt-Right</a>, the Alt-Right started out as an intellectual movement, but then it degenerated into a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html?view=classic">Utopian Ideology</a> that got dumber and dumber since ideologies need to tap into human emotions in order to propagate most effectively. Since the ideology started spreading via emotions instead of reason, this caused all sorts of purity spiraling where the leaders and members of the movement started promoting more extremist and less rational ideas in an attempt to claim status over other members of the movement. <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html?view=classic">This other post &ldquo;Status Pyramid Schemes&rdquo;</a> talks more about how that process and the evolution of memetic ideologies works in general.
</p>

<p>
Race realists like myself don&rsquo;t want a movement that is driven by emotions and deplorable claims to status. We want an ideology that is supported by reason and scientific evidence. We do have some ideas about how to start a philosophical movement that includes race realism without devolving into a virtue-signaling contest, but that will be a post for another time.
</p>

<p>
The second reason why so many race realists tend to be racist is that racist people are more likely to support the idea of race realism, except that they don&rsquo;t have the intellectual or the bio-evolutionary understanding for the tenants of race realism. I <i>refuse</i> to associate with those kinds of people since they are anti-intellectual, believe in unequal rights, and do not have similar goals.

<h2 id="org5767888"><span class="section-number-2">10.</span> Aren&rsquo;t all race realists against race-mixing?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
No. I have mentioned on this page that I am mixed-race. It is true that most racists are against race-mixing to some degree, but as I have already written in this FAQ, racism is not the same thing as race realism. Some race realists are against race-mixing (e.g. Payton S. Gendron, the 2022 Buffalo shooter), but that is mainly because they don&rsquo;t understand that race-mixing is inevitable.
</p>

<p>
In fact, if you go back far enough in history, everybody living today is &ldquo;mixed-race&rdquo; in a sense, and race-mixing was an important part of human evolution. Modern humans were formed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbreeding_between_archaic_and_modern_humans">interbreeding between homo sapiens, neanderthals, and denisovans</a>, to varying degrees for all the races of the world. And that doesn&rsquo;t even include all the races that have mixed, merged, split, appeared, or disappeared since then for all kinds of complicated historical and geographical reasons.

No, the race realists who understand why a eugenostate would be superior to an ethnostate would not want to create an ethnostate. For more information, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/01/eugenostate-versus-ethnostate.html?view=classic">see: Eugenostate versus Ethnostate.</a>

No, not at all. [Elaborate]

For more information, see: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/killing-unicorns.html">see: Killing the Unicorns</a>. This essay explains what race is and isn&rsquo;t, and why races do not necessarily act as collective groups with unified collective interests.

<h2 id="orgcd5a074"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> Isn&rsquo;t The Great Replacement Of White People Just A Myth?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-13">
<p>
No, not at all. The people who are claiming that the Great Replacement Theory is just a myth are following the typical leftist tactic of denying that something bad is happening, but if it is happening, then it&rsquo;s actually a good thing.
</p>

<p>
Statistics consistently show that countries with historically European populations are becoming less and less European. This trend has been happening for decades. And people can pretend that this isn&rsquo;t a problem or that it won&rsquo;t lead to the perishing of white people all they want, but it is undeniable that if the trend continues for several decades, white people will be replaced by other races by and large, unless something happens to reverse the trend and increase the fertility levels of white people.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://eternalanglo.com/">Eternal Anglo</a> is a good data analytics blog that covers the fertility rates of different races in different countries.
</p>

<p>
In fact, given that I am mixed-race and only half-white, I am an example of how white people are slowly getting replaced in the Western World. That&rsquo;s not to say that I&rsquo;m against white people breeding with other races or that I think it should be forbidden, because I don&rsquo;t believe that at all. I&rsquo;m just saying that the evidence is clearly that white people have relatively low fertility compared to other races in Western countries (mass immigration doesn&rsquo;t help with that either), that the population of mixed-race people is on the rise in the West, and if the fertility rates of white people don&rsquo;t increase, then they will get replaced by humans with different genetics. It would be very sad if the Europeans died out, and for that reason, I support white preservationism. If East Asians were at risk of dying out too, then I would support Asian preservationism as well.
