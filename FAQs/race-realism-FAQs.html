<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Race is defined as &ldquo;a statistical cluster of genes&rdquo;, and</li>

</ol>
<p>
That&rsquo;s it. But you have to understand what a &ldquo;statistical cluster&rdquo; is, and what that means with regards to race and genetics, as well as understanding that racial differences are continuous, not discrete like the distinction between species. [Race Realism] != [Racism].

<h2 id="social-construct"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Isn&rsquo;t Race just a social construct?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-social-construct">
<p>
Yes, but that does not constitute an argument against race realism. Rather, it is a false dichotomy: the social construct of beauty does not mean that humans look identical and that their appearance is only a product of perception. Likewise, race is a social construct built on top of a biological reality.
</p>

<p>
Framing race as nothing more than a social construct ignores that race is also a statistical cluster of genes. There are meaningful ways to categorize people into racial groups, and it is valid to inquire into the differences between different human population groups. There are real differences, and that does have implications for social policy and understanding societal outcomes.

No, and this question assumes that Academia can be trusted, even though there are multiple reasons why Academia cannot be trusted:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ideological Bias</li>
<li>Perverse Incentives</li>
<li>Social Circularity</li>

If anything, the overwhelming amount of statistical evidence proves that not all races are created equally in terms of their abilities and, accomplishments, and actions.

No, if there are differences between races, then Occam&rsquo;s Razor concludes that racial differences are the simplest explanation for racial disparities and achievement gaps between races.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
No. Even though everybody might be born knowing virtually nothing (see: <a href="../epistemology/evaluating-tabula-rasa.html">Evaluating Tabula Rasa</a>), this does not prove that all individuals have equal intellectual ability because it ignores that some races are better at learning than others. Every expert was a beginner at some point, but some people (and some races, on average) are better at becoming experts and intellectuals than others.

<h2 id="nazis"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Aren&rsquo;t all race realists racists, Nazis, and/or white supremacists?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nazis">
<p>
The short answer is: No.
</p>

<p>
I for one, am a race realist who believes that people should be judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. The next few subsections elaborate on this and why there is nothing contradictory about being a race realist and non-racist.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc3f683e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc3f683e"><span class="section-number-3">8.1.</span> Race realism does not imply racism.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-1">
<p>
There are many race realists who are not racist (including myself), especially if they are in favor of a eugenostate instead of an ethnostate. A Eugenostate would treat all races equally under the law, but there would be competition regarding who is authorized to reproduce who is forbidden. So while it would be inevitable that some races would be more reproductively successful than others under a eugenostate, there would be legal limitations on people from any race from being able to have children. Eugenostates value equal opportunities, not equality of outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Non-racist race-realists do not advocate that some races be given greater legal privileges than other races. We believe that all people from any race should be entitled to the same legal rights as anyone else. Racism is for the most part and in most cases, a form of irrational discrimination.

<div id="outline-container-org007ffd1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org007ffd1"><span class="section-number-3">8.2.</span> Race realism does not imply white supremacy.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-2">
<p>
In fact, I (ZeroContradictions, the author of this blog) am half Western-European and half East-Asian. I am certainly not a white supremacist since I am mixed-race, as is most of my entire family since both of my parents, all my siblings, and all of my aunts and uncles are also hapas.
</p>

<p>
Race Realism is about acknowledging that every race has genes that made them more reproductively successful in their ancestral environments. But now that we live in modernity, the statistical evidence makes it abundantly clear that some races are better adapted to modernity than others (on average).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-3">
<p>
Race Realism is a scientific position that is backed by empirical evidence and statistics. On the other hand, the Nazis were racists and they backed their beliefs up with propaganda and pseudoscience. The Nazis did not understand what &ldquo;race&rdquo; actually is (a statistical cluster of genes). i

<h2 id="racists"><span class="section-number-2">9.</span> If race realists don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be racist, then why are so many of them racist?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-racists">
<p>
The first half of the answer to this question has to do with memetics and how ideologies evolve over time. As explained in the essay, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-rise-and-fall-of-alt-right.html?view=classic">The Rise and Fall of the Alt-Right</a>, the Alt-Right started out as an intellectual movement, but then it degenerated into a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html?view=classic">Utopian Ideology</a> that got dumber and dumber since ideologies need to tap into human emotions in order to propagate most effectively. Since the ideology started spreading via emotions instead of reason, this caused all sorts of purity spiraling where the leaders and members of the movement started promoting more extremist and less rational ideas in an attempt to claim status over other members of the movement. <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html?view=classic">This other post &ldquo;Status Pyramid Schemes&rdquo;</a> talks more about how that process and the evolution of memetic ideologies works in general.
</p>

<p>
Race realists like myself don&rsquo;t want a movement that is driven by emotions and deplorable claims to status. We want an ideology that is supported by reason and scientific evidence. We do have some ideas about how to start a philosophical movement that includes race realism without devolving into a virtue-signaling contest, but that will be a post for another time.
</p>

<p>
The second reason why so many race realists tend to be racist is that racist people are more likely to support the idea of race realism, except that they don&rsquo;t have the intellectual or the bio-evolutionary understanding for the tenants of race realism. I <i>refuse</i> to associate with those kinds of people since they are anti-intellectual, believe in unequal rights, and do not have similar goals.

<div id="outline-container-race-mixing" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="race-mixing"><span class="section-number-2">10.</span> Aren&rsquo;t all race realists against race-mixing?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-race-mixing">
<p>
No. I have mentioned on this page that I am mixed-race. It is true that most racists are against race-mixing to some degree, but as I have already written in this FAQ, racism is not the same thing as race realism. Some race realists are against race-mixing (e.g. Payton S. Gendron, the 2022 Buffalo shooter), but that is mainly because they don&rsquo;t understand that race-mixing is inevitable.
</p>

<p>
In fact, if you go back far enough in history, everybody living today is &ldquo;mixed-race&rdquo; in a sense, and race-mixing was an important part of human evolution. Modern humans were formed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbreeding_between_archaic_and_modern_humans">interbreeding between homo sapiens, neanderthals, and denisovans</a>, to varying degrees for all the races of the world. And that doesn&rsquo;t even include all the races that have mixed, merged, split, appeared, or disappeared since then for all kinds of complicated historical and geographical reasons.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ethnostate">
<p>
No, the race realists who understand why a eugenostate would be superior to an ethnostate would not want to create an ethnostate. For more information, see: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/01/eugenostate-versus-ethnostate.html?view=classic">Eugenostate versus Ethnostate.</a>

<h2 id="great-replacement"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> Isn&rsquo;t The Great Replacement Of White People Just A Myth?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-great-replacement">
<p>
No, not at all. The people who are claiming that the Great Replacement Theory is just a myth are following the typical leftist tactic of denying that something bad is happening, but if it is happening, then it&rsquo;s actually a good thing.
</p>

<p>
Statistics consistently show that countries with historically European populations are becoming less and less European. This trend has been happening for decades. And people can pretend that this isn&rsquo;t a problem or that it won&rsquo;t lead to the perishing of white people all they want, but it is undeniable that if the trend continues for several decades, white people will be replaced by other races by and large, unless something happens to reverse the trend and increase the fertility levels of white people.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that we should do to prevent the Great Replacement is to tighten immigration into Western Countries. We already have limited resources, so there is no reason to allow more than a trickle of useful immigrants into the West.
