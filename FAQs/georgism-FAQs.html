<div id="outline-container-seasteading" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="seasteading"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Doesn&rsquo;t the existence of land reclamation and seasteading technologies refute your argument that &ldquo;land is finite&rdquo;?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-seasteading">
<p>
No, it doesn&rsquo;t. For one thing, this counter-argument against Georgism completely ignores the fact that we are <i>losing</i> more land due to rising sea levels than whatever land we could ever hope to gain with seasteading. Not only that, but seasteading is <i>extremely</i> expensive since it costs billions of dollars, and it could never produce enough land to go around for everybody. Thirdly, the seasteading argument also ignores that there wouldn&rsquo;t even be a need to seastead more land in the first place if we used the land that we already have more efficiently, which we could most practically accomplish via LVT.
</p>

<p>
And on top of all that, most land reclamation likely won&rsquo;t be permanent. Even though Incheon International Airport was built on reclaimed land, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak-kAdhh8-o">it has been slowly sinking at an alarming rate every year</a>, and this problem will be worsened further to some extent by climate change and rising sea levels. If the numbers are correct and this trend continues, then the airport is projected to sink below sea level within the next 100-200 years. This suggests that land reclamation probably won&rsquo;t be a permanent solution to land scarcity (at least the kind used to create more area for building the airport).

<div id="outline-container-cramming-fallacy" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="cramming-fallacy"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> If you tax land value, then won&rsquo;t all the houses be crammed together and poorly built in order to use as little land as possible?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-cramming-fallacy">
<p>
Nope, that doesn&rsquo;t follow at all. When you increase the supply of housing, you increase competition inside the market. Competition decreases prices and increases the quality of the goods and services available to the consumers.
</p>

<p>
It is also completely wrong to predict that all the houses and apartments would be crammed together. If anything, that&rsquo;s what you see / will see in the current system. Housing is so freaking expensive in Japan that there&rsquo;s literally coffin-sized apartments and POD hotels that people live inside of since they have no other choice. And the West is bound to head that road too in some areas if housing reform is not enacted.
Obviously, the vast majority of people don&rsquo;t want to live inside coffin-sized houses, so they&rsquo;d absolutely be okay with paying more LVT if that buys them more living space. And since landlords would have every incentive to get as many customers as possible, they would have to build something that people <i>want</i> to live in.
</p>

<p>
Clarification: The Land Value Tax is how we make land common property, by taxing away the economic advantage of ownership. Land in the Georgist context is everything belonging to the natural world, however sometimes land value tax isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best tax to use depending on the qualities of the thing belong to the natural world (we also talk about harberger taxes, severance taxes, pigouvian taxes, etc.), but it sometimes gets reduced down to &ldquo;The Single Tax on Land&rdquo; because to us Land is a factor of production that extends beyond the physical surface of the Earth.
</p>

<p>
Since LVT would make landlords pay the same amount of tax no matter how much or how little housing they build on the same plot of land, LVT would encourage landlords to build more housing. This would thus make housing more affordable everywhere, unlike property taxes which make housing more expensive by punishing landlords who build more housing. The result is that the cost of living would vary significantly less from one place to another, which would eliminate the need to adjust the UBI based on every location&rsquo;s cost of living.

<h2 id="NAP-compliant"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Doesn&rsquo;t taxing people&rsquo;s land violate the NAP?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-NAP-compliant">
<p>
No it doesn&rsquo;t, and for several reasons:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Everybody has an equal negative right to land. If you disagree and you are going to argue in favor of <b>unequal</b> rights, then the burden of proof falls entirely on you to prove your claim since you would be arguing for <b>unequal</b> negative rights. This webpage on <a href="../libertarianism/geolibertarian-syllogisms.html">GeoLibertarian Syllogisms</a> has further information on why Anti-Georgism violates the Libertarian NAP.</li>
<li><a href="../libertarianism/geolibertarian-syllogisms.html#GTP">Anti-Georgism leads to an anti-free-market economy</a>, and that certainly isn&rsquo;t compatible with Libertarianism.</li>
<li>The NAP isn&rsquo;t as &ldquo;objective&rdquo; as Libertarians would like to believe. <a href="../libertarianism/case-against-libertarianism.html#NAP">This list</a> shows a huge myriad of ways how Libertarians will disagree with each other, and it is evidence that Aggression is subjective, so the Libertarian Non-Aggression Principle is yet another subjective moral principle that does not form a basis for &ldquo;objective morality&rdquo;.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-socialist-nor-communist">
<p>
No, not in the slightest. A Socialist economy is when <b>Capital</b> is publicly owned, a Georgist economy is when <b>Land</b> is publicly owned while Labor and Capital are privately-owned, and a Communist economy is when all Three of Factors of Production (Labor, Capital, and Land) are publicly owned.

<div id="outline-container-taxes-on-natural-resources" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="taxes-on-natural-resources"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Why would natural resources be taxed under Georgism?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-taxes-on-natural-resources">
<p>
By taxing the economic inputs of the economy instead of the economic outputs, there would be incentives to use the inputs (Natural Resources) more efficiently, and we should absolutely want this since there is a fixed, finite amount of valuable land and natural resources on Earth. Likewise, people wouldn&rsquo;t get penalized for generating greater economic outputs.
</p>

<p>
Although location value taxation would be the main most dominant form of taxation, the taxation of the following would depend on how large the demand for those resources is, relative to the supply:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mineral Deposits</li>
<li>Forests</li>
<li>Fish Stocks</li>
<li>Geostationary Orbits</li>
<li>The Frequencies of the Electromagnetic Spectrum</li>
<li><a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">Reproduction Licenses</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The economics is pretty easy to understand, provided that one has an understanding of supply and demand.

<div id="outline-container-NRT-competitiveness" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="NRT-competitiveness"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t a tax on natural resources make our country&rsquo;s natural resources more expensive, and thus uncompetitive with world markets?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-NRT-competitiveness">
<p>
No, because this question assumes that natural resources would be privately owned and that the Natural Resources Tax would go on top of that, which is not the case at all under Georgism.
</p>

<p>
We already pay enormous corporations like British Petrol, De Beers, Sibanye Stillwater Limited, etc money when we buy natural resources from them. But under Georgism, natural resources would be owned by the government instead, and everybody would pay money (Natural Resources Tax) to the government to buy said natural resources, not the privately owned mega-corporations that shouldn&rsquo;t exist. Since the government would collect the revenue from selling natural resources instead of private corporations and no additional expenses would be added on top of that, Georgism would <i>not</i> make the country&rsquo;s natural resources less competitive on the global market.
</p>

<p>
Another point is that this would be even more impossible if there is a global government that manages the world&rsquo;s natural resources. The whole point of government is to resolve prisoner dilemmas and tragedies of the commons, so it is entirely reasonable to have a global government. The only criticisms that could be applied against a global government are ones that would also apply to national governments as well.
</p>

<p>
If we don&rsquo;t build a global government, a de facto global government will take form instead. Today, that is currently the United Nations, combined with the influence of the Chinese and American superpowers. So we might as well build a global government that is less likely to be a dumpster fire like the UN.
</p>

<p>
Surely you would have to agree with me on this point. It is utterly unreasonable to allow mega-corporations to profit billions of dollars just because they claimed that land first under a finders&rsquo; keepers system. [That is called rent-seeking](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking</a>), and it doesn&rsquo;t contribute to economic growth at all. If anybody is going to be making billions of dollars off of selling coal, oil, iron, copper, cobalt, natural gas, etc, it better be the government so that everybody else can pay fewer taxes (and maybe receive some welfare in return).
