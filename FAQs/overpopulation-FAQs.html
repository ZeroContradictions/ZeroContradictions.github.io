<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-malthusianism-and-overpop-threat">
<p>
No, Malthusianism has not been debunked. The simplest way to disprove Cornucopianism (the opposite of Malthusianism) is to point out that it is absurd to insist that there can be infinite population growth within a finite environment.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, just because we haven&rsquo;t face overpopulation yet, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will never happen. Everything that was thought impossible, but was possible, only seemed impossible until it actually happened. Even though Thomas Malthus&rsquo;s predictions on the world&rsquo;s maximum population have been proven wrong so far ever since the Industrial Revolution began, that doesn&rsquo;t make Cornucopians right because it&rsquo;s equivalent to saying &ldquo;Well I haven&rsquo;t died yet, so I will never die&rdquo;, even though that is absurd. Everybody knows that life cannot live forever, and likewise, everyone ought to know that infinite growth is impossible within a finite environment.

<h2 id="PC-and-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> How is Population Control Related to Eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-PC-and-eugenics">
<p>
When a population reaches the carrying capacity of its environment, competition and eugenic selection occur in order to select the organisms that are the most reproductively successful in the scarce resources environment.
</p>

<p>
By removing the selectionary pressures on humanity and limitations that have traditionally limited the carrying capacity of the human population, not only does this cause dysgenics from the removal of said selectionary pressures, but it also causes overpopulation. That said, if we achieved legally-enforced population control for humanity, then we would be placing artificial selectionary pressures that will increase the eugenic quality of the human population, that would otherwise never occur.
</p>

<p>
If someone is going to be in favor of population control, ought to be in favor of bottom-up eugenics as well (top-down eugenics would fail the same reason why command economies fail). Many people today are against eugenics because it would require restricting some people from having children, but population control does the same thing and population control will be necessary in order to prevent catastrophic disasters from happening in the future, so this is not a good argument against eugenics.

<h2 id="georgism-and-EPC"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> How is Georgism Related to Population Control?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-georgism-and-EPC">
<p>
Georgist reasoning compliments the population control scheme that we want to implement extremely well, and not by coincidence if we expand the notion of &ldquo;natural resources&rdquo; to also include the finite supply of organisms that can exist within a finite environment. Since life is a zero-sum competition game for energy when a population reaches its carrying capacity, anybody who has children in such an environment would be doing so at the cost of preventing other people to have children as well. This is very similar to how anybody who occupies a parcel of land prevents other people from using that parcel.

<h2 id="why-DTT-is-wrong"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Why is Demographic Transition Theory incorrect?</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/demography-and-destiny.html?view=classic">Here&rsquo;s the long answer.</a>
</p>

<p>
TL;DR: The religious fundamentalists and other people with the highest fertility rates will out-compete the rest of the entire world, and the genes and memes that caused child-free people to choose not to have children will die out. The end result will be that the genes that caused higher fertility rates will become more populous, and this will cause the world population to skyrocket once more until it crashes against the carrying capacity ceiling. The world population will <b>not</b> max out at 11-12 billion people, and if it does, that will only be because the world population reached the carrying capacity of the Earth.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-DTT-misconceptions" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="DTT-misconceptions"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> But doesn&rsquo;t that reasoning conflate memes with genes?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-DTT-misconceptions">
<p>
No, and for several reasons:
</p>

<p>
First off, religious people tend to be dumber than Atheists. So if dumb hyper-religious people are having more children than smart Atheists, then the world&rsquo;s average IQ is projected to decline (it&rsquo;s already started), which will make the world population more susceptible to becoming more religious again. The dumb people will outbreed the smarter people, unless smarter people start having more children.
</p>

<p>
Second, Atheists are ignoring the concept of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html?view=classic">Adaptive Coherence</a>. Basically, genes and memes work together, so if memes like religion are currently causing religious people to have more children, then the genes that are associated with higher religious beliefs are going to get reproduced with greater frequency than genes that make people more likely to be Atheist and such.
</p>

<p>
Third, Atheists are further ignoring that memes can be reasonably categorized into <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/12/god-is-telomeme.html?view=classic">&ldquo;Traditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fashions/Cults&rdquo;</a>. Religions would be categorized as &ldquo;Traditions&rdquo; because they propagate from parent to child and tend to increase reproductive success, whereas memes like Feminism and Antinatalism would be categorized as fashions because they tend to propagate between peers, not from parents to children. Fashions like Feminism and Antinatalism may be temporarily increasing in popularity now, but they neither promotes reproductive success, so they are both destined to decline in their numbers of believers, given enough generations passing by. Fashions tend to be temporary phenomena, whereas Traditions are stable phenomena because they tend to outlast Fashions in the long-term.
</p>

<p>
Fourth, populations cannot be thought of as conglomerates because different segments of the population have the potential to grow exponentially. Consider the following quoted paragraphs from the essay <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/demography-and-destiny.html?view=classic">Demography and Destiny</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For example, Islam is expanding rapidly due to population growth. That is because Muslims, and especially fundamentalist Muslims, have higher average fertility. They keep women in the home making babies. The Muslim world has grown more fundamentalist in the last 50 years, mainly because fundamentalists had more children than secularists and moderates in Muslim societies. Islam is now spreading to the West, due to population pressure. Muslims are replacing the declining native population of Europe, which has very low fertility.
</p>

<p>
There are other examples of religions that promote fertility. Take the Amish for example. Their current rate of population growth corresponds to doubling every 20 years. That is almost entirely due to reproduction &#x2013; there is very little conversion into the Amish community. At their current rate of growth, the Amish population would exceed the current world population in less than 300 years, starting from its current size of 250,000. If everyone else went through the demographic transition except the Amish, then after 300 years the global population would be almost entirely Amish.
</p>

<p>
In spite of being anti-modern, the Muslims and the Amish are adapted to modernity. They reproduce their genes and their memes. As time goes on, other adaptations will emerge. One thing is certain: humanity will not settle into a stable pattern of low fertility unless we impose it on ourselves. -Blithering Genius

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-pops-arent-self-regulating">
<p>
No, because Demographic Transition Theory <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/demography-and-destiny.html?view=classic">(DTT) is wrong and cannot be trusted</a>. In a nutshell, genes and memes that promote high fertility will be selected for over the next several generations, and that will cause the world population to spike upwards again in a century or so.

<h2 id="nowhere-close-bogus"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> But humanity is nowhere close to overpopulation!</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nowhere-close-bogus">
<p>
That is false. There are plenty of signs and examples of overpopulation in various regions of the world:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In 2022, the world is currently facing a global food shortage caused by extreme heats, droughts, the Russian invasion of Ukraine (which caused supply shortages for wheat, corn, vegetable oil, and more), and other factors. Moreover, the world is likely to face a recession soon, which will further exacerbate the problem. Here&rsquo;s a Wikipedia article with more information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_food_crises">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_food_crises</a></li>
<li>Another example of overpopulation is how the world is likely to face water shortages in the next several decades.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Here&rsquo;s a video on the upcoming Water Crisis in China and Southeast Asia. Over a billion people face uncertainty regarding their future water supplies: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRUc4gTO-PE">China&rsquo;s Upcoming Water Crisis</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For instance, Beijing has had to cap its maximum population to 23 million people: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-capital-idUSKBN0M215620150306">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-capital-idUSKBN0M215620150306</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Water Scarcity is also a growing problem in India: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity_in_India">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity_in_India</a></li>
<li>And Iran: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity_in_Iran">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity_in_Iran</a></li>
<li>And Africa: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity_in_Africa">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity_in_Africa</a></li>
<li>And Mexico: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity_in_Mexico">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity_in_Mexico</a></li>
<li>And South Africa: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TuZlEy_HFk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TuZlEy_HFk</a></li>
<li>Not even developed countries like the US can guarantee that they won&rsquo;t be facing water shortages in the near future. Just look at this photo of Hoover Dam and Lake Mead:      <img src="https://www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2021/07/Lake-Mead-compare-levels-07052021.jpg?resize=876,492" alt="Lake-Mead-compare-levels-07052021.jpg?resize=876,492" /></li>

<p>
Based on a correct understanding of how evolution works, a recognition that Earth has finite resources (with the above examples and then some), and an understanding that infinite population growth is mathematically unsustainable when resources are finite, we support legally-enforced population control via reproduction licenses. We don&rsquo;t support population control because we want eugenics, we support it because we want humanity to avoid famines and the wars that would result from said famines.

<p>
Since population control would cause us to move from the traditionally high fertility levels that human societies have historically had to relatively low fertility levels, this would necessitate redefining the role of women in society, compared to what it has been traditionally (raising children and housekeeping). Since a society with population control would also be a society where women raise fewer children on average, this would mean that women would be spending more time doing other things, like working paid jobs in the economy.

If a meteor was heading towards Earth, would you argue that we shouldn&rsquo;t destroy or redirect it, merely because it would be &ldquo;too difficult&rdquo; to try that?

If you were on the Titantic and heading towards an incoming iceberg, would you argue that we shouldn&rsquo;t redirect the ship&rsquo;s route, merely because that could possibly have &ldquo;unintended consequences&rdquo;? This argument could be applied to literally anything, and if taken to its logical conclusion, that would mean that we should never try or do anything out of the fear that even the slightest risk never makes any action worthwhile. One might as well never get out of bed at that point.
