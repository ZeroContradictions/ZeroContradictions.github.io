<h2 id="what-is-overpop"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> What is Overpopulation?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-is-overpop">
<p>
Overpopulation is when there is an excessive number of occupants (people, animals, plants, etc.) in a particular area; specifically, when the number of occupants exceeds the ability of that area to provide for them. Overpopulation is preceded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_overshoot">ecological overshoot</a>.
</p>

<p>
The primary misconception of overpopulation is that it only depends on the number of organisms/people. This view assumes that the only factor that matters for overpopulation is the number of organisms within the environment. It further assumes that, if a certain number of individuals can be supported <i>in the present</i>, there&rsquo;ll be no problems <i>in the future</i>, <a href="#overpop-can-happen-instantly">which I&rsquo;ve debunked here</a>.
</p>

<p>
This view is wrong and very ignorant about biology. Overpopulation is determined by at least four parameters:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Number of creatures (usually of a single species) in an area</li>
<li>An area and its resources</li>
<li>The average ecological footprint per creature (for humans, this is the average standard of living per capita)</li>
<li>A timeframe</li>
<li>(for humans) The technology and substitution options available to those creatures</li>
<li>(for humans) The distribution of wealth and opportunities (which is <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html">heavily influenced by the system of property norms</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
To quote from <a href="http://www.justopia.org/overpopulation---malthus-being-wrong-doesnt-make-you-right.html">&ldquo;Malthus Being Wrong Doesn&rsquo;t Make You Right&rdquo;</a> on justopia.org:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1,000 people living in the fertile crescent isn&rsquo;t overpopulation. 1,000 people living on a 2-acre island would almost certainly be so. An area can support far fewer people living first world lifestyles (50-100 full-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_slave">energy slaves</a>) than ones living like the typical African bushman.
</p>

<p>
Overpopulation also considers the amount of time a population can be sustained, though one could argue this ties into &ldquo;the resources in an area&rdquo; bullet point. Right now, humans are drawing down oil reserves which have taken millions of years to form. If we&rsquo;re only considering the resources humanity has, 8 billion people can probably be sustained until the energy returned on energy invested from oil becomes nearly 1:1. There may be enough time for humanity to switch to different energy sources like nuclear energy, but it&rsquo;s not guaranteed&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The concept of overshoot requires a time dimension. Given widely known technology, humans are in overshoot now. That means that without finding a new energy source or drastically lowering the ecological footprint per person (AKA having a shittier lifestyle), there is simply <i>not</i> going to be 8 billion humans alive simultaneously within 100 years: the current number of humans on Earth is simply <i>not sustainable</i>. ― Justin D Keith

<h2 id="malthus-was-wrong"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Hasn&rsquo;t Malthusianism been debunked?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-malthus-was-wrong">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> is widely regarded as the most famous early intellectual of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics">population dynamics</a>. In 1798, Malthus wrote &ldquo;An Essay on the Principles of Population&rdquo;, stating:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Must it not then be acknowledged by an attentive examiner of the histories of mankind, that in every age and in every state in which man has existed, or does now exist:
</p>

<p>
That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence.
</p>

<p>
That population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase.
</p>

<p>
And that the superior power of population it repressed, and the actual population kept equal to the means of subsistence, by misery and vice?&ldquo;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Malthus was correct that human populations had historically been limited by subsistence farming (at the time he wrote the essay), but he was wrong that this would always be the case in the future because he didn&rsquo;t correctly anticipate the discovery of additional energy sources, and didn&rsquo;t see the contributions people like Norman Borlaug made through genetically engineering crops. So Malthus&rsquo; thesis about linear production versus exponential consumption rates was incorrect. However, what Malthus&rsquo;s claim in the essay is different from the definition of <b>Malthusianism</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Malthusianism</b>: The theory that potentially exponential population growth can surpass the linear growth of an environment&rsquo;s carrying capacity (including its food supply and other resources), which eventually causes members of the population to die off until settling back down to the carrying capacity.
</p>

<p>
<b>Neo-Malthusianism</b>: The theory and concern that overpopulation (and overconsumption) may increase resource depletion and/or environmental degradation and lead to ecological collapse or other hazards. Neo-Malthusianism is often coupled with advocacy of human population planning to ensure sufficient resources for current and future human populations as well as for other species.
</p>

<p>
We are <i>not</i> defending what Malthus wrote in 1798 (that populations are limited by subsistence farming). Instead, <a href="#malthusianism-cornucopniasm">we are arguing in favor of <b>Malthusianism</b></a>, which is a completely different concept that can be defended by an upgraded knowledge of history, population dynamics, and evolutionary reasoning. It does not follow that Malthus being wrong means that the concepts of overpopulation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_overshoot">ecological overshoot</a> are incorrect, not applicable to humans, or not a risk which bears investigation. We support well-grounded Neo-Malthusian solutions as a solution to the overpopulation disaster that is bound to plague humanity within the 21st century.

<h2 id="malthusianism-cornucopniasm"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> How is overpopulation a threat to humanity? Why is Cornucopianism Wrong?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-malthusianism-cornucopniasm">
<p>
The simplest way to disprove Cornucopianism (the opposite of Malthusianism) is to point out that it is absurd to insist that there can be infinite population growth within a finite environment. It was explained in <a href="#what-is-overpop">this section</a>, that Overpopulation depends on much more than just the number of organisms. Of course, Cornucopians will argue that humanity will invent new technologies and better economic policies that expand the carrying capacity, but <a href="#technology-wont-save-us">this is debunked in this section</a>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, just because we haven&rsquo;t faced overpopulation yet, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will never happen. Everything that was thought impossible, but was possible, only seemed impossible until it actually happened. Even though Thomas Malthus&rsquo;s predictions on the world&rsquo;s maximum population have been proven wrong so far ever since the Industrial Revolution began, that doesn&rsquo;t make Cornucopians right because it&rsquo;s equivalent to saying &ldquo;Well I haven&rsquo;t died yet, so I will never die&rdquo;, even though that is absurd. Everybody knows that life cannot live forever, and likewise, everyone ought to know that infinite growth is impossible within a finite environment.

<p>
If the Earth experiences the largest never-seen-before overpopulation event that it&rsquo;s heading towards, we are going to experience what will definitely be the largest <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html?view=classic">famines and wars ever seen before in human history</a>.
</p>

<p>
There will be very dire and catastrophic consequences if don&rsquo;t regulate the world population.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Food shortages and associated malnutrition, susceptibility to disease, stunted growth and stunted brain power, starvation</li>
<li>Peak oil, which greatly impacts food supply.</li>
<li>Per capital water shortage and poor water quality, which greatly impacts food supply and human health</li>
<li>Climate change which creates hotter, more hostile crop growing conditions and flooding, also hostile to crops.</li>
<li>Shortage of nonrenewable resources, particularly fertilizer, necessary for crop production, but also other resources needed for manufacturing, without which our materialistic civilization will grind to a halt.</li>
<li>Environmental damage caused by the quest for more fossil fuels and essential metals, destruction of animal habitat caused by urbanization.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overpopulation is like a runaway train, and the longer we wait to do something about it, the harder it will be to deal with the impacts. It&rsquo;s common sense that we should figure out a way to prevent this doomsday scenario from ever happening while we still can.
</p>

<p>
Going by a. Food shortages alone, it will only get worse unless we quickly stabilize population and find some as-yet-discovered agricultural advancement. The Green Revolution has petered out. Overpopulation causes rural farming people to outgrow their lands, so the grown children move to cities. Urbanization eats up farmland, reducing crop production. Also growing seasons are becoming hotter, so many crops fail due to heat and drought. Overuse of the soils caused by overpopulation leads poor nourishment for crops and eventually desertification. Overpopulation draws on available water to the point that there is not enough to water crops. Aquifers are overdrawn to the point where they are not replenished fast enough.

<p>
Most people don&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s possible for overpopulation to happen both instantly and unpredictably if a major catastrophe happens, just like the Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849). Once the potato was introduced to Ireland, the country had a population explosion since the crop increased the number of available calories and nutrition to the population.

Nobody would&rsquo;ve predicted in 1843 or 1844 that the island would be infected with a blight within the next year that would cause a massive famine where a million people die and another million have to emigrate. One year, the island was not overpopulated because it had enough resources for everybody. The next year, it was facing famine and mass exodus. That&rsquo;s how quickly overpopulation could potentially happen, if the catastrophe causing it is severe enough.
</p>

<p>
The key to causing overpopulation to have a new staple crop or technology that causes a population boom, followed by some event which disables the stimuli / resources that were responsible for the population boom. Although the population growth leading up to an overpopulation event might happen gradually, the catastrophe that leads to the overpopulation can happen instantly and unpredictably. All it takes is a major and/or unprecendented catastrophe, and everything changes. Since it&rsquo;s always possible for an unpredictable colossal catastrophe to cause instant overpopulation, that means that ideally we should <b>always</b> be prepared against a potential overpopulation crisis.

Based on a correct understanding of how evolution works, a recognition that Earth has finite resources (with the above examples and then some), and an understanding that infinite population growth is mathematically unsustainable when resources are finite, we support legally-enforced population control via reproduction licenses. We don&rsquo;t support population control because we want eugenics, we support it because we want humanity to avoid famines and the wars that would result from said famines.

No, because the reasoning used to make this conclusion relies on false assumptions about biology, evolution, and fertility.

The religious fundamentalists and other people with the highest fertility rates will out-compete the rest of the entire world, and the genes and memes that caused child-free people to choose not to have children will die out.

<p>
In a nutshell, genes and memes that promote high fertility will be selected for over the next several generations, and that will cause the world population to spike upwards again in a century or so.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-overpop-free-rider-problem" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="overpop-free-rider-problem"><span class="section-number-3">6.1.</span> Overpopulation is a Free-Rider Problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-overpop-free-rider-problem">
<p>
The problem with assuming that overpopulation can be solved by most people choosing to have fewer children is that many people will choose <i>not</i> to have less children. The people who choose to have the highest fertility levels while everybody else has a below-replacement fertility thus create a free-rider problem. They will benefit from having a higher reproductive success, their children will benefit from having more resources available for them to exploit since everybody else chose to have fewer children, and everybody else will be negatively affected because they had lower reproductive success and fewer resources available for them since the high-fertility people left behind fewer resources for everybody else. For more info, see: <a href="#life-is-zero-sum">every existing organism can only exist at the cost of another</a>.
</p>

<p>
The human population will not be limited by voluntary low fertility, because evolution will eliminate the memes and genes associated with voluntarily low fertility. In an environment of abundance, in which most offspring live to adulthood, high fertility is selected for. Even if most people choose low fertility today, by doing so they select against the traits that make people choose low fertility. The future is determined by who shows up. Human nature (like the nature of every other kind of life) is determined by who reproduces. Those who reproduce pass their traits on. Modern abundance has not taken the struggle out of life. It has just changed the nature of the struggle, from a struggle over resources to a breeding contest. Right now, whoever has the most kids wins.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s true that most people in developed societies choose to have few or no children. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that most people in the future will have low fertility. Why? Because people in the future have to be born, and more of them will be born to people with high fertility than low fertility. Even if almost everyone chooses low fertility, those with higher fertility will simply outbreed them in a few generations. For example, the Amish alone, could replace the entire world population in less than 300 years, at their current rate of growth.

</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-DTT-misconceptions" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="DTT-misconceptions"><span class="section-number-3">6.2.</span> But doesn&rsquo;t that reasoning conflate memes with genes?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-DTT-misconceptions">
<p>
No, and for several reasons:
</p>

<p>
First off, religious people tend to be dumber than Atheists. So if dumb hyper-religious people are having more children than smart Atheists, then the world&rsquo;s average IQ is projected to decline (it&rsquo;s already started), which will make the world population more susceptible to becoming more religious again. The dumb people will outbreed the smarter people, unless smarter people start having more children.
</p>

<p>
Second, Atheists are ignoring the concept of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html?view=classic">Adaptive Coherence</a>. Basically, genes and memes work together, so if memes like religion are currently causing religious people to have more children, then the genes that are associated with higher religious beliefs are going to get reproduced with greater frequency than genes that make people more likely to be Atheist and such.
</p>

<p>
Third, Atheists are further ignoring that memes can be reasonably categorized into <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/12/god-is-telomeme.html?view=classic">&ldquo;Traditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fashions/Cults&rdquo;</a>. Religions would be categorized as &ldquo;Traditions&rdquo; because they propagate from parent to child and tend to increase reproductive success, whereas memes like Feminism and Antinatalism would be categorized as fashions because they tend to propagate between peers, not from parents to children. Fashions like Feminism and Antinatalism may be temporarily increasing in popularity now, but they neither promotes reproductive success, so they are both destined to decline in their numbers of believers, given enough generations passing by. Fashions tend to be temporary phenomena, whereas Traditions are stable phenomena because they tend to outlast Fashions in the long-term.
</p>

<p>
Fourth, populations cannot be thought of as conglomerates because different segments of the population have the potential to grow exponentially. Consider the following quoted paragraphs from the essay <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/demography-and-destiny.html?view=classic">Demography and Destiny</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For example, Islam is expanding rapidly due to population growth. That is because Muslims, and especially fundamentalist Muslims, have higher average fertility. They keep women in the home making babies. The Muslim world has grown more fundamentalist in the last 50 years, mainly because fundamentalists had more children than secularists and moderates in Muslim societies. Islam is now spreading to the West, due to population pressure. Muslims are replacing the declining native population of Europe, which has very low fertility.
</p>

<p>
There are other examples of religions that promote fertility. Take the Amish for example. Their current rate of population growth corresponds to doubling every 20 years. That is almost entirely due to reproduction &#x2013; there is very little conversion into the Amish community. At their current rate of growth, the Amish population would exceed the current world population in less than 300 years, starting from its current size of 250,000. If everyone else went through the demographic transition except the Amish, then after 300 years the global population would be almost entirely Amish.
</p>

<p>
In spite of being anti-modern, the Muslims and the Amish are adapted to modernity. They reproduce their genes and their memes. As time goes on, other adaptations will emerge. One thing is certain: humanity will not settle into a stable pattern of low fertility unless we impose it on ourselves. -Blithering Genius

It is true that the birth rate is declining. But the population is still increasing, just more slowly.

<p>
In the interest of preserving modern civilization and preventing war, disease, and famine, there must be a <a href="./EPC-FAQs.html#LMPL">maximum population limit</a> enforced for the country&rsquo;s total number of citizens by requiring anybody who wants to have children to acquire a Reproduction License for each child that they want to have. A reproduction license will be granted to every married couple who manages to meet all of the following requirements:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Citizen must be law-abiding and have no criminal record,</li>
<li>The Citizen must have a high school education [at least] and be at least 18 years old,</li>
<li>The Citizen must be legally married to someone. Both partners must sign a legal agreement with the government pledging responsibility for raising the child by themselves,</li>
<li>One of the couples in the marital agreement must be employed in a full-time job,</li>
<li>The Citizen must have paid all their <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html">Land Value Tax payments</a> (if any),</li>
<li>The Citizen must pay the Reproduction Tax for having a child, which is set according to market rates with respect to the <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">Supply, Demand, and Price of Reproduction Licenses</a>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></li>

<p>
For more information about how these requirements were chosen, see: <a href="./EPC-FAQs.html#why-laissez-faire-is-best">this section</a>.
</p>

<p>
The social control of reproduction is not a new idea. It is a very old and almost universal practice. In the past, reproduction was controlled by the institution of marriage. Almost every society had some form of marriage that regulated human sexual behavior. Sex outside marriage was not allowed. We abandoned the traditional control of reproduction without understanding its function or the consequences of abandoning it. We are now seeing the consequences (and paying the costs) of abandoning marriage. It is time to replace marriage with a modern form of reproduction control.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-chinas-one-child-policy">
<p>
No, it would be done very differently. For the record, we strongly condemn how the One Child Policy was implemented in China.
</p>

<p>
First off, we are not proposing that every couple should be limited to only one child. Instead, we are proposing <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">an equitable solution where people can have as many children as they have reproduction licenses for</a>, as according to the supply, demand, and price of reproduction licenses.

</p>

<p>
Third, we have outlined <a href="#banning-female-infanticide">several measures that a government can implement that are guaranteed to prevent female infanticide</a>. Over time, cultural factors would also favorably prevent infanticide of all kinds.

<h2 id="banning-female-infanticide"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Would regulating reproduction cause female infanticide in countries like China and India?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-banning-female-infanticide">
<p>
No, because we can assume that any government that has the power to enforce EPC would also have the authority to enforce a law that bans female infanticide. In the interest of ensuring an equalized sex ratio for the country&rsquo;s population, female infanticide will be outlawed, unless it can be proven that the fetus/infant had severe birth defects, a severe genetic disease, etc. If it married couples were tempted to kill their female children because they wanted a son instead, then the government could simply create a law that forbids that married couple from ever possessing another reproduction license and the couple would not get a refund, which would guarantee an equalized demographic sex ratio. All parents must accept the sex of the child that they give birth to, or else they will be forbidden from having any children at all.
</p>

<p>
Since a married couple would have to have a reproduction license <i>before</i> they conceive a child in the womb, the government could ensure that that the child will be born by contractually requiring the prospective parents to carry the child until birth, regardless of the sex of the fetus. This would prevent couples from trying to abort female fetuses while they are still in the womb. If the child was aborted for any reason, then the reason has to be documented. If the reason for the abortion was merely because the fetus was female, then the couple would permanently lose their reproductive rights and would not get a refund.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, since shifting to a relatively low fertility country (in comparison to historical trends) would necessitate that women would be spending more time doing other things besides just raising children, that should cause female children to be perceived as being more valuable in countries where female infanticide is a cultural problem, which would further help to reduce the problem altogether.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if a couple of parents only had daughters born, but they still wanted a son, then they can still have a son as long as they buy another reproduction license and they happen to give birth to a son. Generally speaking however, creating artificial barriers to reproduction would make having children of higher social status because having children would become harder to achieve. This is a good thing because it would cause parents to value their children more, regardless of whatever sex they children may be born as.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-licenses-and-elderly">
<p>
No, because population control would be enforced via reproduction licenses, but if this is what the question is referring to, then this misunderstands what the reproduction licenses are for. They are not a license for a person to live, they are a license for a married couple to have a child in one if they meet <a href="#overpop-solution">the requirements</a>. Since only a finite maximum number of children can be born within each year, this would mean that the total population of the country would have very little variation and would stay roughly constant for many years or decades, assuming that the government doesn&rsquo;t pass a law to change the maximum population birth rate.

<h3 id="georgist-reasoning-and-elderly"><span class="section-number-3">9.1.</span> Would Georgist reasoning conclude that Government-Enforced Population Control requires killing the elderly if the population becomes too large?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-georgist-reasoning-and-elderly">
<p>
Some Georgists might object that if we limit the number of people who can be born each year on the basis that it is economic land (every married couple needs a license for each child that they have), then everybody also needs a license to live since the country has a legal maximum population size, and therefore only a finite number of people can live in the country at a time.
</p>

<p>
But this does not follow because under the EPC system that we are proposing, there would be <a href="#LMPL">some amount of buffer room</a> between the Legal Maximum Population Limit (LMPL) and the carrying capacity of the environment to avoid overpopulation, so if the carrying capacity dropped during an emergency, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a need to decide who gets to live and who doesn&rsquo;t, nor would it be necessary to kill off the most elderly members of the society in the event of an overpopulation crisis (when the population is dangerously higher than the carrying capacity).

<h2 id="PC-and-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">11.</span> How is Population Control Related to Eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-PC-and-eugenics">
<p>
When a population reaches the carrying capacity of its environment, competition and eugenic selection occur in order to select the organisms that are the most reproductively successful in the scarce resources environment.
</p>

<p>
By removing the selectionary pressures on humanity and limitations that have traditionally limited the carrying capacity of the human population, not only does this cause dysgenics from the removal of said selectionary pressures, but it also causes overpopulation. That said, if we achieved legally-enforced population control for humanity, then we would be placing artificial selectionary pressures that will increase the eugenic quality of the human population, that would otherwise never occur.
</p>

<p>
If someone is going to be in favor of population control, ought to be in favor of bottom-up eugenics as well (top-down eugenics would fail the same reason why command economies fail). Many people today are against eugenics because it would require restricting some people from having children, but population control does the same thing and population control will be necessary in order to prevent catastrophic disasters from happening in the future, so this is not a good argument against eugenics.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-georgism-and-EPC">
<p>
Georgist reasoning compliments the population control scheme that we want to implement extremely well, and not by coincidence if we expand the notion of &ldquo;natural resources&rdquo; to also include the finite supply of organisms that can exist within a finite environment. Since life is a zero-sum competition game for energy when a population reaches its carrying capacity, anybody who has children in such an environment would be doing so at the cost of preventing other people to have children as well. This is very similar to how anybody who occupies a parcel of land prevents other people from using that parcel.

Since population control would cause us to move from the traditionally high fertility levels that human societies have historically had to relatively low fertility levels, this would necessitate redefining the role of women in society, compared to what it has been traditionally (raising children and housekeeping). Since a society with population control would also be a society where women raise fewer children on average, this would mean that women would be spending more time doing other things, like working paid jobs in the economy.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-technology-wont-save-us">
<p>
Cornucopians greatly overestimate the power of technology.
</p>

<p>
For one thing, technology has had <a href="../journey/transhumanism-vs-anprimism.html#problems-caused-by-technology">many negative effects on society, and in many cases, it backfired by making society arguably worse</a>.
</p>

<p>
To whatever extent that technological advancement has temporarily raised the Earth&rsquo;s carrying capacity, this ignores that technology has also been fueling a demand for higher standards of living all around the world, which is more taxing on the environment and thus increases the risk for overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
One of the problems with assuming that technology will solve overpopulation is that industrial technologically advanced societies require large populations in order to sustain themselves, lest there will be no specialization and no division of labor.
</p>

<p>
Relying on technology to always raise the society&rsquo;s carrying capacity is not a viable solution because populations naturally reproduce to infinity, and the only thing holding them back is the carrying capacity and the natural selection that results from that. Right now, the primary selectionary pressure on the human genome is birth control, which selects people who consciously choose to have children. Once the human population adapts to resist the limiting effects that birth control has on the human population, an unstoppable population explosion will happen, unless breaching the carrying capacity causes war, disease, and famine.

Yes, they did and still do. Regardless of your opinion on eugenics, it is a guilt by association fallacy to oppose something solely because someone else supports it. Doing so would be as fallacious as saying: &ldquo;Nazis drank water, so drinking water is bad!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Moreover, opposing eugenics is naive and misguided too.

<h2 id="rights"><span class="section-number-2">20.</span> But having children is a right.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-rights">
<p>
We&rsquo;re not proposing that no one should be able to have children, we&rsquo;re just proposing that there should be reasonable limits on how many children people should be allowed to have. Nowadays, most children live to adulthood, so it&rsquo;s not as necessary as it was historically to have as large families anyway. As explained here, <a href="#why-DTT-is-wrong">voluntarily low fertility is not a feasible solution</a> for preventing overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
Rights are whatever people decide they are, and circumstances can cause peoples&rsquo; opinions to change on what rights should be, so the only legitimate rights are legal rights. Moral rights are nonsense since <a href="./post-moralism-FAQs.html">morality depends on perspective</a>.
</p>

<p>
Licenses are already required to adopt children, so based on that fact alone, it is logically inconsistent to <i>not</i> also require licenses for people to have biological children.

This does not follow because the future worth to society from a child is mostly genetic, since the estimated inheritability for IQ due to genetics is <a href="https://jaymans.wordpress.com/jaymans-race-inheritance-and-iq-f-a-q-f-r-b/#notgenes">well-documented to be about 70-80%</a>. Most people are of average intelligence, and a <i>lot</i> of mediocre people would need to be born to get the one Einstein or cancer curer. For every new child who is born, it&rsquo;s also far more likely that would only be one of the billions of people who are further contributing to the next overpopulation crisis, rather than raising the Earth&rsquo;s carrying capacity or doing other things that would otherwise contribute to Humanity more than whatever toll they have from consuming more resources. Each new low-to-average intelligence people is going to have their own interests (which won&rsquo;t necessarily be productive or constructive) and competition for scarce resources. It would definitely be more rational to find ways to make existing people more intelligent or useful to others while enforcing <a href="./EPC-FAQs.html#reproduction-license-reqs">reasonable population control measures</a>, rather than continuing to allow unregulated reproduction.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-black-plague-false-predictions">
<p>
I once had a history teacher who estimated that that the current population of Europe would be 10 times greater if the Black Plague never happened, but this uses fallacious reasoning. There&rsquo;s no way that could ever happen anyway since that would require increasing the carrying capacity of Europe by ten-fold as a result of the black plague never happening.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the Black Plague did reduce the European population by about a third, but since biological populations are selected to reproduce up to the carrying capacity, it&rsquo;s more likely that the black plague only temporarily widened the gap between the current population and its maximum carrying capacity. Since there were temporarily more resources per capita available to all the living humans due to the massive decline in population, this means that the surviving humans were likely able to have more children than previous generations. Thus, the European population would&rsquo;ve returned to the carrying capacity irregardless of whether the plague ever happened.

<h2 id="next-overpop-crisis"><span class="section-number-2">24.</span> What will Humanity&rsquo;s Next Overpopulation Crisis look like?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-next-overpop-crisis">
<p>
The next major overpopulation crisis will probably happen when a catastrophic event causes the carrying capacity to suddenly and unexpectedly shrink, rather than the population surpassing a stagnant carrying capacity. If this happens, it&rsquo;ll probably less likely to be caused by a blight or disease in the food supply since modern agricultural techniques probably use more genetically diverse crops, but we still cannot underestimate the potential for such massive catastrophes. Instead, the next major event that could cause a worldwide overpopulation crisis is more likely to be a massive war (which restricts the food supply for much of the world via embargoes, blockades, destruction of food production).
</p>

<p>
The people of today who are not concerned with overpopulation and ridicule Malthus for being wrong (so far) tend to believe that overpopulation would look like the Earth&rsquo;s population and the Earth&rsquo;s resources both increasing (the latter due to technological advancements), with Earth&rsquo;s population increasing faster. Not only does this ignore the possibility that a major/unprecendented catastrophe could cause overpopulation to happen instantly, but it&rsquo;s also less likely than the catastrophe-caused scenario since a severe catastrophe could happen at any moment.
</p>

<p>
All it will take to prove that Neo-Malthusianism concerns are/were warranted is for an unprecendented emergency to happen. For example, suppose the following series of plausible geopolitical events occurs:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>China invades Taiwan,</li>
<li>The US military defends Taiwan,</li>
<li>India takes the opportunity to attack China and seize Tibet while China is distracted,</li>
<li>Japan and South Korea support Taiwan&rsquo;s defense as well in order to protect their international trading routes through the Strait of Taiwan,</li>
<li>North Korea might takes the opportunity to attack South Korea while they are distracted,</li>
<li>Every country around the world picks a side (China vs the US),</li>
<li>WWIII starts,</li>
<li>massive food shortages begin everywhere due to the disruption of free trade, and</li>
<li>the world faces unprecedented overpopulation due to all of the aforementioned.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is a very realistic scenario, especially amid the recent rapid growth of the Chinese military and increasing Chinese aggression around Taiwan. The Russian invasion of Ukraine shouldn&rsquo;t leave the world doubting that China could follow suit and invade Taiwan whenever it chooses. If this or a similarly catastrophic scenario occurs, Neo-Malthusianism will be proven right <b>eventually</b>. Once again, History shows that overpopulation can happen unpredictably within mere months, so anyone would be incredibly naive to think that it&rsquo;s never something to worry about.
