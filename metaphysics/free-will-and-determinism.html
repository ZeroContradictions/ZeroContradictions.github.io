<h3 id="org5e00836"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Definitions Of Free Will</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Before we can even talk about this topic, we have to define free will. There are at least three types:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Metaphysical Free Will (MFW): Determinism is false (this is the opposite of determinism). This does not exist and can be disproven by proof by contradiction.</li>
<li>Subconscious Epistemic Free Will (SEFW): The ability for you to <b>subconsciously choose</b> <b>something</b>, regardless of whether you can actually do it or not, and also regardless of whether determinism is true or false. Having subconscious choices is the exactly same thing as having needs, desires, or preferences. If SEFW exists, then value also exists. ALL sentient organisms have SEFW.</li>
<li>Conscious Epistemic Free Will (CEFW): The ability for you to <b>consciously choose</b> to do what you want, regardless of whether you can actually do it or not, and also regardless of whether determinism is true or false. CEFW is more complex than SEFW since it requires more than just merely desiring things that would satisfy one&rsquo;s needs/desires. It also requires understandingly what exactly that you want, and knowing how to get it.</li>
<li>Attainable Free Will (AFW): The two conditions that: 1. you can choose to do as you want, and 2. you are able to do it within your current circumstances. Since being conscious is a requirement in order to be &rsquo;capable&rsquo; of doing something, Attainable Free Will has to be conscious by definition, and it would be the case that Subconscious Attainable Free Will does not exist. Likewise,  Conscious Attainable Free Will is the exact same thing as AFW.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9bfa16b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9bfa16b"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Clarifications On Free Will</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The keyword for Epistemic Free Will is <b>choose</b>. If an individual is merely capable of choosing to do what they want, then they have EFW.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Likewise, if an organism merely has &rsquo;desires&rsquo;, then they have EFW because &rsquo;desires&rsquo; are a form of choice, even if the desires are subconscious.</li>
<li>When we typically think about &rsquo;choices&rsquo; and the ability to choose, we typically think about making choices that we are consciously aware of, but they don&rsquo;t always have to be conscious choices (in which case they would be desires because desires are defined as unconscious choices).</li>
<li>Thus, in order for an individual to not have EFW, they would not only have to be incapable of making conscious choices, but they would also have to be incapable of having any desires.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If free will does exist, obviously there has to be some specific neurological requirements to achieve it:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sufficient dopamine levels</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Free will (doing as you please) exists on a spectrum of determinism and free will, which would be especially implied by the fact that certain hormone levels are required to achieve free will.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free will is defined as being able to do the things that you want to do.</li>
<li>As an example, I would say that my brother doesn&rsquo;t have free will due to his autism, my mom has far more free will than he does, I have more free will than my mom does, and someone who has a brain similar to mine ((Zero Contradictions)&rsquo;s brain), but one that doesn&rsquo;t have a tendency to hyperfocus and always has sufficient dopamine levels probably has more free will than (Zero Contradictions).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This should probably be written as a thought experiment where the two (Zero Contradictions)&rsquo;s are called &rsquo;(Zero Contradictions) 1&rsquo; (the (Zero Contradictions) in real life) and &rsquo;(Zero Contradictions) 2&rsquo; (a hypothetical (Zero Contradictions) with an even better brain). (Zero Contradictions) 2 would probably be more successful than (Zero Contradictions) 1.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People who have greater amounts of free will are definitely more successful than those who have lesser amounts of free will.</li>
<li>Obtaining greater amounts of free will is most definitely a virtue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Since SEFW requires sentient organisms, a universe without sentient life is also a universe without SEFW (and also without CEFW and AFW by implication).</li>
</ul>

<li>An individual is unconscious or only subconscious, so they don&rsquo;t have CEFW or AFW, even though they may have desires.</li>

<h3 id="org36b6d57"><span class="section-number-3">1.5.</span> Summary</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>
The definition of free will that most people think about when answering whether it exists or not is metaphysical free will, the opposite of determinism.
</p>

<p>
So in the simplest of words, all the different main definitions of free will can be summed up in the following stages:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The metaphysically contradictory definition</li>
<li>Having subconscious desires</li>
<li>Having desires and knowing how to fulfill them</li>
<li>Having desires, knowing how to fulfill them, and being able to fulfill them</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Both the somatic and the autonomic nervous systems are deterministic, they just have different inputs.</li>
<li>Even if it is possible to explain the human mind entirely through physics, philosophy is still good for forming tentative explanations on how it works.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Furthermore, explaining the mind through physics would absolutely require correlating externally observable behavior with the physical phenomenons inside the human brain.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NOTE: It is interesting to think about determinism while listening to the TempleOS Hymn.</li>
<li>If every event that will ever happen in the universe is already pre-determined beforehand to happen, then the logical conclusion is eternalism.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thus growing-blockism and presentism are incorrect.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If I could remove my brain from my body and observe the world as it is, it would be even more apparent that we don’t have free will. I would just see a bunch of billiard balls all bouncing off of each other.</li>
<li>That is deterministic too. The sperm cell that reaches the egg cell first did so because of physics, which is inherently deterministic.</li>
<li>Yeah, but like I said. Physics determines which sperm cell reaches the ovaries first, so even though fertilization has huge probabilities, it’s still deterministic.</li>
<li>All of the stuff that happens inside my body is also deterministic, including but not limited to my beating heart, my breathing lungs, my thinking brain, my digestion of food and water, and so on.</li>
<li>And if fertilization isn&rsquo;t deterministic, then what is it? Free will? How would free will play a role at in fertilization?</li>
<li>Just because everything is deterministic, that doesn’t mean we can predict the future. There’s like, literally a million factors at hand, but it’s all still deterministic.</li>
<li>But what causes the causes? It eventually all goes back to the Big Bang, and we’re still trying to figure that out.</li>
<li>It is precisely because humans can be influenced by external factors that they don’t have free will. If humans truly had free will, then they would be invulnerable to being influenced by external factors at all.</li>
<li>Yes, it is self evident that we have free will in the sense that we can do as we please. But our actions are still deterministic because it is deterministic that we will do as we please. We do as we please because we are programmed to do as we please. Does that make sense?</li>
<li>We think and feel as we please because we are programmed to think and feel as we please. Do you like any better?</li>
<li>Yes, that is self-evident. We are dealing with two different definitions of free will, and they are both true and consistent with each other.</li>
<li>Yes, we have, &ldquo;choices, desires, and intentions,&rdquo; but why are we to believe those emerge out of anything besides a programmed brain, one which is the result of indoctrination and genes over which we had no control? Scientists can make you do things via tcms and you will perceive the involuntary behaviors as ones which you yourself created when you in fact did not. I&rsquo;m proposing that the ways in which we&rsquo;re primed to behave, via nature/nurture, is akin to tcms. We feel utterly in control, yet nevertheless said freedom is an illusion. Consciousness is merely a limited manner of witnessing some sort of tier in the processing of our behavior. It&rsquo;s like our brain does most of the filtering subconsciously, eventually giving rise to a few behaviors to process consciously, and one behavior eventually reaches an action potential that results in one action over others.</li>
<li>If we truly had metaphysical free will, then wouldn&rsquo;t people with mental disorders be able to act as if they don&rsquo;t have mental disorders? If every human brain is a computer, then they act the way they do because there is something wrong with their computer.</li>
<li>Ever since the Big Bang, the possiblity for deterministic materialistic sentient life has existed in a deterministic, materialistic cause-and-effect universe. DNA does not have a brain, so it is essentially a self-replicated molecule that has no idea what it is doing. Nonetheless it created humans that sometimes know what they&rsquo;re doing. Humans and all other life does not have metaphysical free will because metaphysical free will does not exist. Sure we can do as we please, but when we do so, it is a result of our materialistic brains.</li>
<li>Just think, all of your ancestors&rsquo; actions back then were completely deterministic, and even though they didn&rsquo;t know what the future would be like back then, their deterministic actions eventually caused the existence of my family and myself.</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t the fact that humans have trouble coming up with random sentences to say, translate, etc. on the fly that aren&rsquo;t from their recent memory or relating to things they really like or are familiar with serve as further evidence that humans do not have free will? Yes it does.</li>
<li>Perhaps another way to view the universe is that since everything inside it is ultimately deterministic, in a way, no one is necessarily evil or necessarily good since everything that anybody has ever done or was ever going to do was already predetermined.</li>
<li>Materialism is a form of philosophical monism that holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental states and consciousness, are results of material interactions. According to philosophical materialism, mind and consciousness are by-products or epiphenomena of material processes (such as the biochemistry of the human brain and nervous system), without which they cannot exist.</li>
<li>The reason why humans have trouble to stop doing routine physical movements that they used to do as habits is because those movements are hardwired into their physical memory until they are deprogrammed completely, which relates back to the fact that metaphysical free will does not exist.</li>
<li>Potential Free Will</li>
<li>Christians believe in free will because it helps them get into heaven.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If self-awareness is one of the first major markers of conscious life, then recognizing that all life is materialistic, deterministic, and completely devoid of free will is the second (and final?) major step for conscious life to take.

<h2 id="orgeec1ea0"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Determinism Versus Freedom</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
It is not necessary to acquire any more proof that free will doesn&rsquo;t exist - because true freedom cannot exist:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Suggesting there&rsquo;s free will in a cause-and-effect universe is like saying there&rsquo;s &ldquo;triangular roundness&rdquo;. (Free will and Determinism are mutually contradictory and incompatible)</li>
<li>Suggesting the universe isn&rsquo;t cause-and-effect, requires that a non-cause could &ldquo;cause something&rdquo;. (How could something happen if it wasn&rsquo;t caused to happen?)</li>
<li>Suggesting the universe isn&rsquo;t deterministic but random means &ldquo;randomness&rdquo; determines the outcome of the universe. Randomness is a completely broken piece of rhetoric, because even granting its veracity still means &ldquo;randomness&rdquo; is determining outcome, and since that still means outcome is being determined then it&rsquo;s still deterministic)</li>
</ol>
<p>
An objective thinker must understand what constitutes &ldquo;broken semantics&rdquo;, &ldquo;logical incoherence&rdquo;, &ldquo;closed concepts&rdquo; and &ldquo;impossibility&rdquo;. Then the model of reality can always be put together, and eventually completely put together, regardless of all junk data &#x2013; the many forms of junk data in the world.
</p>

<p>
Evidently, here are the most popular junk data conclusions in the world, aside from the delusion of divinity:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>That the case for reality can only be left hanging in uncertainty.</li>
<li>That everything boils down to subjective perspective.</li>
<li>That nothing ever matters.</li>

<h2 id="org519046e"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The Deterministic Effects That Parents Have Over Their Children</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
When parents decide to have children, they effectively have the power to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Choose where the children live, and in what conditions</li>
<li>Choose the native language(s) that the children speak, and potentially also their second language(s) too.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This indirectly affects which people the children can make friends with, their economic and educational opportunities, and the media that they can access</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choose what the children eat (since they are the ones with the responsibility to feed them)</li>
<li>Choose the children&rsquo;s education</li>
<li>Indoctrinate the children with their beliefs, including religion, politics, and other cults</li>
<li>Choose the activities that the children do</li>
<li>Choose the children&rsquo;s names</li>
<li>Choose how many siblings the children have, and extend their family histories to the children</li>
<li>Inseminate the children with whatever genes they have, which can affect things including but not limited to: the children&rsquo;s interests, the children&rsquo;s intelligence, the children&rsquo;s looks, the children&rsquo;s physical condition, and the children&rsquo;s quality of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When parents have the power to raise their children however they want, they could easily trap those children in a box, and they would never be able to escape until they become adults.
</p>

<p>
The point of this list is to demonstrate that no one ever has any Epistemic Free Will over the circumstances that they grew up with.

<h2 id="orgc91868e"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Some Mathematical Wisdom On Free Will</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
&ldquo;Choice&rdquo; does not have to be arbitrary. In principle, if you somehow knew absolutely everything there was to know about the current state of the world, it is possible that you would be able to predict everyone&rsquo;s choices in the future with 100% accuracy - but they still remain choices. They may be predetermined on a very fundamental level, but for practical purposes it does not make a lot of difference whether you assume them to be predetermined or not.
</p>

<p>
Mathematics has a very interesting branch called &ldquo;chaos theory&rdquo;. What is studied there are models in which small variations in initial conditions lead to dramatic changes in the outcomes. There is a good reason to believe that the Universe as a whole is fairly chaotic; the &ldquo;butterfly effect&rdquo; seems to be quite real.
</p>

<p>
What this implies is that it is extremely hard, if not altogether impossible, to predict choices people will make in the future. When I go to the store tomorrow, will I buy a bottle of wine or not? So many minor factors may affect this choice that the best you can hope to do in the foreseeable future is to give a very-very rough probabilistic estimate of the chances of me doing that.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you build a very simple general intelligence AI that has the ability to self-learn and modify its own code. The initial code may be very simple, and you might even be able to memorize it in the extreme case - yet, once you launch the AI, just a few seconds later its code will likely become completely unrecognizable and incomprehensible to you. Even though this AI was specifically pre-programmed by you, its choices are still virtually unpredictable.
</p>

<p>
To me, it does not matter whether &ldquo;true&rdquo; free will exists; I believe that it does not and, furthermore, it cannot logically, but that is not very important. What is important is that people&rsquo;s will is free in that chaotic sense outlined above. If choices cannot be accurately predicted in practice, then they might as well be considered free in the true, fundamental, sense as far as practical considerations go.
</p>

<p>
And people certainly should be held accountable for their non-coerced choices. If I murder someone, then I hardly can appeal to determinism to claim that I could not help it and became a victim of some grand mechanism no one has any control over; it was still me murdering someone in peaceful circumstances. It was still me violating their rights.
</p>

<p>
Although it is practical in most cases to pretend that metaphysical free will exists even though it doesn&rsquo;t exist in any form at all, this pretending should NOT be done in all cases, especially ones where the problems to be solved require acknowledging the non-existence of MFW, such as resolving abnormalities in neurological structures that cause things like OCD, dementia, etc.
</p>

<p>
Thought on Statistics: If the universe is deterministic and eternalism is correct, then the purpose of statistics is just to predict the course that determinism will take. Regardless of what happens, everything will be known in the future after the events are over, provided that the information was recorded somehow for future generations to see and decipher.

<h2 id="org8125f81"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> Unsorted Text For Clarifying Definitions On Free Will</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
If the definition of metaphysical free will is determinism is false, then the definition of metaphysical free will is essentially equivalent to libertarianism / libertarian free will.
</p>

<p>
A problem with distinguishing between compatibilists and hard determinists is that many of them agree on the same thing, but they just merely disagree over the semantics for portraying and believing in the same ideas. BG for example identities as a compatibilist, he understands that &ldquo;free will&rdquo; is merely the universe&rsquo;s determinism flowing through an individual as they perceive it via their own volition. So he essentially does understand that everything is deterministic. And then there are people like Cosmic Skeptic who have decisively argued that all compatibilists would have to concede to hard determinism due to the metaphysical nature of causation and the universe.
</p>

<p>
You must explicitly address and resolve this semantics problem. You might have to clarify some definitions.

<h3 id="orga71c244"><span class="section-number-3">6.1.</span> More Notes on Free Will</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
There are only two reasons why anybody would ever (purposely) do anything in their life:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They want to.</li>
<li>They are forced to.</li>
<li>They did it accidentally (but of course, nobody would argue that free will existed here anyway).</li>
</ol>

<p>
What sounds sound like depends on how our brain interprets and perceives them, as evidenced by people with Auditory Processing Disorder
</p>

<p>
If self-awareness is one of the first major markers of conscious life, then recognizing that all life is materialistic, deterministic, and completely devoid of free will is the second (and final?) major step for conscious life to take.
</p>

<p>
I believe that in some languages, it is the case that the verb meaning &ldquo;to desire/want&rdquo; is the same as the verb &ldquo;to choose&rdquo;. So when I write about free will in my personal philosophy, I make an explicit distinction between those two semantic meanings, whereas most philosophers don&rsquo;t since the difference is already obvious due to the language (usually a European one) that they&rsquo;re using to communicate their ideas.
</p>

<p>
Difference between choice and decision, if any:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Choices are just choosing.</li>
<li>Decisions are choices that involve a rational process that weighs pros and cons, consequences, etc. Decisions are thorough applications of reasoning before making choices.</li>
</ul>
