<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Why I&rsquo;m Writing This Glossary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
In my opinion, the term &ldquo;virtue-signaling&rdquo; should&rsquo;ve been first coined by Ted Kaczynski, and it&rsquo;s a shame that he wasn&rsquo;t the one to invent the term. He had a golden opportunity to invent the term and become known for inventing it when he was addressing it in his 1995 manifesto &ldquo;Industrial Society and Its Future&rdquo;. He repeatedly wrote in the manifesto that he just couldn&rsquo;t think of a better term to describe what he was trying to talk about. Kaczynski hit the nail on the hammer that [virtue signaling] is largely a result of the Power Process being disrupted in industrial-technological society, but unfortunately he referred to &ldquo;virtue signaling&rdquo; as &ldquo;leftism&rdquo; in his manifesto since the term had not been invented yet and he hadn&rsquo;t thought of it. This naturally drew a lot of criticism from leftists, but it would have drawn less hostile criticism if he would have been the first to coin the neologism, especially since it would&rsquo;ve communicated a more specific meaning and would&rsquo;ve been more easily differentiable as a different concept.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Richard Dawkins coined the term &ldquo;meme&rdquo; so that he could better describe a new field of knowledge that is related to evolution and biology, and he gained a lot of fame since he was the first person to invent the neologism and use it to communicate a very important and interesting phenomenon for describing how the world works.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot I could say about semantic fields and how the invention of new words for specific concepts leads to faster neurological retrieval of those concepts, but writing about it would overwhelm me at the moment. By coining my own neologisms, it will help to popularize this blog since it will gain more notoriety for being the first or among the first sources to have ever used the term, if it catches on in popular language.
</p>

<p>
Many of the terms defined on this webpage were not invented by myself, but they are displayed here anyway for quick reference, and so that newcomers to this website can learn its jargon quickly.

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Epistemology</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Epistemology</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Reason</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Reasoning Skills</dt><dd>the same thing as critical thinking skills, but better wording IMO.</dd>
<dt>Empirically-Grounded Coherentism</dt><dd>Coherentism where beliefs are ultimately based one&rsquo;s own empiricism.</dd>
<dt>Epistemological Nexus</dt><dd>(Currently no definition exists, but this term could be used to identify or describe <b>something</b> that previously had no specific name.</dd>
<dt>Materialism (Metaphysics)</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Determinism</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Metaphysical Free Will (MFW)</dt><dd>Determinism is false (MFW is the opposite of determinism). This is essentially the same thing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_(metaphysics)">Libertarian Free Will</a>, which does not exist in reality, and can be disproven by proof by contradiction.</dd>
<dt>Subconscious Epistemic Free Will (SEFW)</dt><dd>The ability for you to <i>subconsciously</i> <b>choose</b> something, regardless of whether you can actually do it or not, and also regardless of whether determinism is true or false. Having subconscious choices is the exactly same thing as having needs, desires, or preferences. If SEFW exists, then value also exists. ALL sentient organisms have SEFW.</dd>
<dt>Conscious Epistemic Free Will (CEFW)</dt><dd>The ability for you to <b>consciously choose</b> to do what you want, regardless of whether you can actually do it or not, and also regardless of whether determinism is true or false. CEFW is more complex than SEFW since it requires more than just merely desiring things that would satisfy one&rsquo;s needs/desires. It also requires understandingly what exactly that you want, and knowing how to get it.</dd>
<dt>Attainable Free Will (AFW)</dt><dd>The two conditions that: 1. you can choose to do as you want, and 2. you are able to do it within your current circumstances. Since being conscious is a requirement in order to be &rsquo;capable&rsquo; of doing something, Attainable Free Will has to be conscious by definition, and it would be the case that Subconscious Attainable Free Will does not exist. Likewise,  Conscious Attainable Free Will is the exact same thing as AFW.</dd>
<dt>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what we don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; (Plato&rsquo;s Problem Clause)</dt><dd>&ldquo;According to all available evidence and my current knowledge, this is the correct conclusion | the correct conclusion is: &#x2026;&rdquo;</dd>
<dt>Humble Skepticism (or some other better term?)</dt><dd>The willingness to be open to new ideas and the ability to admit when one is wrong.</dd>
<dt>Cultural Education/Indoctrination/Instillation/&#x2026;</dt><dd>&#x2026;</dd>
<dt>Measurement Omission</dt><dd>The process in which the human mind forms abstract patterns from its sensory input that form the basis for concepts. Measurement Omission is necessary for forming many concepts, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type%E2%80%93token_distinction">types from tokens</a> that one observes.</dd>
<dt>Faith</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Rationalized</dt><dd>Attempting to make something seem reasonable, even if actually isn&rsquo;t. This term can be applied to both metaphysics/epistemology or ethical / political philosophy, and while it can always describe someone&rsquo;s attitude or actions towards facts about the former, it seems less applicable to apply it to people&rsquo;s ethical or political opinions since morality is subjective, and most of the time when people do rationalize their ethical or political opinions, it is typically done in an attempt to justify oneself according to the Law of Egoism, in which case self-justification or self-rationalization may be better terms.</dd>
<dt>Self-Justification / Self-Rationalization</dt><dd>The psychological tendency for life to justify its own existence, beliefs, and actions for the sake of its own continued existence, even if their beliefs are wrong, their existence doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything meaningful according to rational beings, and their actions work against post-moral cooperation ethics.</dd>

<dt>Post-Moralism</dt><dd>The philosophical position that game theory is the best way to understand morality.

<li>NOTE: I am aware that I am defining Cynicalism in a non-standard way, but I am doing so because I feel that the most common definition of &ldquo;Cynicalism&rdquo; is too closely related to the definition for &ldquo;Selfishness&rdquo;, and I feel that &ldquo;Cynicalism&rdquo; would be better used to convey a shade of meaning that most people tend to mistakenly associate with the headword &ldquo;Selfishness&rdquo;. By explicitly defining &ldquo;Selfishness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cynicalism&rdquo;, I can contrast the two definitions to show what &ldquo;Selfishness&rdquo; is not what most people think it is.</li>

<dt>Moral Accounting System (MAS)</dt><dd>The system of emotions in a human&rsquo;s brain (and some other species&rsquo; brains too) that motivates people to do give-and-take behavior, or exchanges of labor. Evolution caused the MAS to develop in humans since they are more reproductively successful when they engage in give and take behavior within human tribes. The MAS is the primary reason why people are not <b>cynical</b>, and the behavior that MASs encourage does not count as &ldquo;reciprocal altruism&rdquo; since &ldquo;reciprocal altruism&rdquo; is an oxymoron.</dd>

<dt>The Rhetoric of Exploitation</dt><dd>A Classic Tactic used by Utopian Ideologists to replace rationalist thinking with rhetoric and self-righteous nonsense. The key is to use selective metaphors and phrases and portray the &ldquo;oppressors&rdquo; as having agency and the &ldquo;victims&rdquo; as having no agency.
