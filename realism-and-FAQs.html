            Hello and welcome to my philosophy blog. My name is ZeroContradictions, and on this home page you will find links to my philosophical writings <font color="red">(highlighted in red)</font>, as well as links to posts from blogs written by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy <font color="blue">(highlighted in blue)</font>, and links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <font color="green">(highlighted in green)</font>. As per its name, the goal of this blog is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: As of November 2022, the vast majority of the red link posts written by myself are unfinished, and have sections that need further elaboration and/or updating with my current beliefs, but I'm publishing what I have already written for now for others to read if they'd like. If you have any constructive criticism on this blog's HTML/CSS design (it's my first time designing a website), please reach out to me at <a class="my-essays" href="meta/contact-page.html">my contact page</a>. I will probably have to learn how to write some PHP code in order to optimize this blog's design.

<h2>Understanding Biological Realism and Evolution</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>This section contains a list of essays by Blithering Genius about Biological Realism and Evolution, which I consider to be the best material there is on the Internet for fully understanding Evolution.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html?view=classic">Life is Intrinsically Violent</a>
        <p>Violence is inescapable from life due to the war, disease, and famine that are inevitably caused when a population reaches its carrying capacity.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html?view=classic">Why Selfishness Always Beats Altruism</a>
        <p>People will use and define "altruism" and "selfishness" in confusing ways, but the most coherent definition of "altruism" always loses to the most coherent definition of "selfishness", energetically, biologically, and psychologically.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K97OP2p9JTQ">Pathological Altruism</a>
        <p>Pathological Altruism is a phenomenon of collective irrationality caused by social delusion, and a virtue-signaling tragedy of the commons.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/rk-selection-theory-is-bogus.html?view=classic">Understanding Evolutionary Reasoning and why r/K Selection Theory is Bogus</a>
        <p>r/K Selection Theory is fallacious and has no expalnatory power. The second half of this essay gives a great explanation of how evolution works.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/07/kin-selection-theory-is-wrong.html?view=classic">Why Kin Selection Theory is Wrong</a>
        <p>There is very little evidence of kin altruism in nature, other than parental care of offspring. Kin Altruism is a myth used to justify utopian ideologies.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/02/we-cannot-transcend-evolution.html?view=classic"> We Cannot Transcend Evolution</a>
        <p>We can never escape from the evolutionary process that creates and maintains the human form. We can change the environment in which this process operates, but we cannot escape from the process itself.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/bees-are-not-social.html?view=classic">Bees are not Social, Debunking Altruism Myths, and the Organism Unit of Selection</a>
        <p>An insight into bee biology. Moreover, bees are not altruistic, and the primary unit of selection for bees is the Queen since all genes flow through her.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-balance-of-nature.html?view=classic">The Balance of Nature</a>
        <p>Ecosystems and organisms always tend towards evolutionary stable states.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/10/competition-in-nature.html?view=classic">Competition in Nature</a>
        <p>Competition in Nature exists between individuals, types/populations, genes/traits, and social groups. This essay talks about each of them.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/12/god-is-telomeme.html?view=classic">A Framework for Memetic Theory</a>
        <p>Memes can be divided into Traditions and Fashions / Cults, based on how they usually spread from one person to another.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html?view=classic">Adaptive Coherence</a>
        <p>Genes and memes work together hand-in-hand, and different biologies will produce different kinds of societies.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/family-and-society.html?view=classic">Family, Transfers of Energy, and Exchanges of Labor</a>
        <p>How net energy flows from father to mother to children; and the evolution of exchanges of labor within human tribes (moral accounting systems).</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/game-theory-and-society.html?view=classic">Game Theory & Society</a>
        <p>An Introduction To Game Theory And How It Shapes Society.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/12/a-paradox-of-rationality-and-cooperation.html?view=classic">A Paradox of Rationality & Cooperation</a>
        <p>A narrative about the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>More Topics on Biological Realism</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/killing-unicorns.html?view=classic">Understanding What Race Is and Isn't</a>
        <p>A racial category is a statistical cluster of correlations among genetic variants. Blithering Genius talks about the implications of this, and debunks myths about race.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/06/its-probably-mostly-genetic.html?view=classic">Why Most Racial Disparaties Are Probably Mostly Genetic</a>
        <p>Blithering Genius argues why the environmental factors affecting racial disparaties are highly dependent on genes, especially since most people in the Modern West are not lacking any important environmental input to their development.</p></li>

    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/01/sex-death-and-complexity.html?view=classic">Sex, Death, and Complexity</a>
        <p>Sex, death and complexity are all linked. Not all complex systems are organized around reproductive bottlenecks. But some are, and you are one of them.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/diet-and-human-evolution">Diet and Human Evolution</a>
        <p>Cooking was a very important part of human evolution, and Blithering Genius talks about this, with some external links to reliable sources.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/09/evolution-and-morality.html?view=classic">Evolution and Its Implications on Morality</a>
        <p>The simplest resolution to the conflicts between evolution and morality is to discard morality, but unfortunately it is easier for most people to reject the truth about life than to reject morality.</p></li>

    <li><a class="my-essays" href="economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">Why Georgism and EPC Both Imply Each Other</a>
        <p>Why you can't have one without the other, stated using syllogistic reasoning. The essay concludes that we should prioritize the promotion of which one would be easier to get into the Overton Window, in order to achieve the other as well.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/killing-unicorns.html?view=classic">Understanding What Race Is and Isn't</a>

        <p>Blithering Genius makes the case that mass immigration can break down social structures, cause cultural instability, weaken competitiveness with other countries, increase a country's dysgenics, increase unsustainable population growth, and create economic imbalances. BG also debunks several popular arguments in favor of mass immigration.</p></li>

        <p>The Founding of The United States Created a Country Ripe with Many Freedoms, Abundant Natural Resources, and Whose Location Away From Europe Selected For Innovative People Who Had to be looking for the best location to start their life. Those conditions have since deteriorated, in large part due to the Thermodynamics of Globalization.</p></li>

        <p>Veritasium explains how there is no scientific evidence to prove that people can be categorized as visual, audible, or hands-on learners. If anything, all of those mediums of teaching should be used whenever they're appropriate for the situation, and the public's failure to realize this has diminished the quality of education worldwide.</p></li>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="FAQs/georgism-FAQs.html">FAQs About Georgism</a>
        <p>Explaining the following and so much more: why Georgism would solve the tragedy of the commons, why there would still be incentives to improve property even if land is owned to everybody, why the Ancaps have more in common with the Communists than the Georgists, why Henry George brainstormed the political philosophy in the first place, etc.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="FAQs/post-moralism-FAQs.html">FAQs About Post-Moralism, Selfishness, and Altruism</a>
        <p>Not believing in objective morals is similar to not believing in God, the rejection of an imaginary ontology that doesn't exist.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs.html">FAQs About Overpopulation and Malthusianism</a>
        <p>Everything that was thought impossible, but was possible, only seemed impossible until it actually happened. The same applies to Overpopulation and Malthusianism.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html">FAQs About EPC And Reproduction Licenses</a>
        <p>Licenses are required to adopt children, so what's wrong with requiring licenses to have biological children? Requiring a license to have children is the simplest, most practical, and least authoritarian solution to reestablish positive selective pressures on the human genome.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="FAQs/race-realism-FAQs.html">FAQs About Race Realism</a>
        <p>The Academic consensus on race realism has been tainted by ideological bias. Race realism is a scientific position that acknowledges evolutionary differences, does not imply racism, and does not oppose race-mixing.</p></li>

<h2>Why Libertarianism Is Impractical</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>I used to be a Libertarian and an Ancap myself for about 4 years, so I've spent hundreds of hours thinking about this stuff, hence why I have so many posts on this blog dedicated to writing my thoughts about Libertarianism and why it's naive.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="libertarianism/case-against-libertarianism.html">The Case Against Libertarianism and Anarchism</a>
        <p>This article explains why I eventually rejected both Libertarianism and Anarcho-Capitalism, why the NAP is bogus, and why libertarian societies are not sustainable.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="libertarianism/geolibertarian-syllogisms.html">GeoLibertarian Syllogisms</a>
        <p>Having an equal right to land is a negative right, and is also necessary for a truly free-market economy. Alloidal Libertarians contradict themselves on this, and this was the first issue that caused me to reject Libertarianism.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="libertarianism/malthusianism.html">Malthusianism Vs Cornucopianism: Why Cornucopianism is Wrong</a>
        <p>For one thing, it is always possible for overpopulation to happen instantly and unpredictably if a massive catastrophe occurs, just like in the case of the Irish Potato Famine; Why the Cornucopian Perception of Resources and Environmentalism is Wrong.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="libertarianism/rothbardian-ancapism-failures.html">Why Rothbardian Anarcho-Capitalism Would Fail Miserably</a>
        <p>Anarcho-Capitalism would replace government and political parties with morally-righteous political corporations that would fight each other constantly over power and morally superiority, thus combining tribal warfare and market failures with democracy's worst problems.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="libertarianism/free-markets-circular-reasoning.html">"Free" Markets In Ancapistan Would Have To Rely On Circular-Reasoning</a>
        <p>Government and the Rule of Law are necessary to establish the free market, lest the market be neither free nor fair.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="libertarianism/five-questions.html">Response to Larken Rose's Five Questions on Government</a>
        <p>The correct answers to Larken Rose's five questions are: Yes, Yes, N/A, Yes, and It depends. Larken Rose was the self-rightenous moron who persuaded me to join the Ancap cult until I left 2 years later.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-case-against-anarchism.html?view=classic">The Case Against Anarchism</a>
        <p>Blithering Genius explains how Anarchism fails to solve problems of cooperation for large-scale societies, ignores the implications of evolutionary theory for human nature. Arbitrary anti-authoritarian morals are not a foundation for a functioning, technologically-advanced, large-scale society.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLcqJ2DclEg">Government is Necessary to Build Infrastructure</a>
        <p>Infrastructure for EVs won't be built unless enough people have already bought EVs to make it profitable enough to do so, and people won't buy EVs unless there's enough infrastructure to support using them.</p></li>
