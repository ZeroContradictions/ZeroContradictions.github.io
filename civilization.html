            Hello and welcome to my philosophy blog. My name is ZeroContradictions, and on this home page you will find links to my philosophical writings <font color="red">(highlighted in red)</font>, as well as links to posts from blogs written by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy <font color="blue">(highlighted in blue)</font>, and links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <font color="green">(highlighted in green)</font>. As per its name, the goal of this blog is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: As of November 2022, the vast majority of the red link posts written by myself are unfinished, and have sections that need further elaboration and/or updating with my current beliefs, but I'm publishing what I have already written for now for others to read if they'd like. If you have any constructive criticism on this blog's HTML/CSS design (it's my first time designing a website), please reach out to me at <a class="my-essays" href="meta/contact-page.html">my contact page</a>. I will probably have to learn how to write some PHP code in order to optimize this blog's design.

<h2>Civilization and Its Trajectory</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="civilization/ideal-government.html">Defining An Ideal Government Structure</a>
        <p>My proposal for defining an ideal government and its legal code, and the best solutions to the game-theoretic problems that every society must face.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-deep-state-and-myth-of-democracy.html?view=classic">The Deep State and the Myth of Democracy</a>
        <p>There are many ways how democracies can be rigged with corruption. It is a myth that democracy is the rule of the people, as the real rulers are the Deep State.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-establishment.html?view=classic">The Establishment</a>
        <p>Government, Big Business, Politicians, the Media, and the Academy all collude to maintain the social order and the Deep State.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBBre3bpvyk">The Best Type of Corruption</a>
        <p>Polymatter: If corruption is inevitable within any type of political system, then we should strive to have this type of corruption more than any other.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/01/technology-and-progress.html?view=classic">Technology and Progress</a>
        <p>Technology and Progress have been largely stagnant over the past 50 years, and this essay explains why that's the case. We cannot transcend the human condition, and the biggest problems of the 21st century will be political and philosophical problems, not scientific nor technological ones.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-rise-and-stagnation-of-modernity.html?view=classic">The Rise and Stagnation of Modernity</a>
        <p>1969 was the turning point for when major improvements to the human condition in the developed world greatly slowed down.<p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AoDTlbRRkw">Why Modern Civilization Will Never Recover If It Falls</a>
        <p>Blithering Genius explains that if modern civilization collapses, the fossil fuels that powered it will already be all used up, hence the necessary energy won't exist anymore to restart it. The scientific knowledge, technological complexity, social complexity, and economic complexity will all fall apart if that happens.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9gu-Nodlnc">Pragmatopia: A List of Things that could be Done to Save the West</a>
        <p>We must expand rationality, reviatalize the West, create a global government, enact EPC, and create a sustainable financial system funded by LVT.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="civilization/improving-democracy.html">Ideal Forms of Democracy</a>
        <p>When and when not to use democracy; Why Replacing FPTP Will Not Improve Democracy; best types of democratic procedures for different situations; Analysis of presidential, parliamentary, and proportional representation democracies; Why the United States should've switched to a parliamentary democracy in the 1970s; Reason Systems</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="civilization/age-of-adulthood.html">Determining What The Legal Age Of Adulthood Should Be</a>
        <p>I list some good arguments in favor of lowering the legal age to adulthood to 16 years old, or when a person graduates high school.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="civilization/cooperation-vs-collectivism.html">The Difference Between Collectivism and Collaboration</a>
        <p>The Problem with Collectivism, how Collectivists mistakenly frame examples of Collaboration and Cooperation as Collectivism, etc.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="civilization/boosting-western-fertility.html">Ideas for Increasing Fertility Rates in the West</a></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="civilization/solving-climate-change.html">Addressing Global Warming And Climate Change</a>
        <p>In the absence of a global government, the best way to solve climate change will probably be to alter the Earth's atmosphere so that it blocks out more sunlight.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvQTmTPZix4">The Case for Insect Agriculture</a>
        <p>Insects have many advantages over livestock: they are cheaper, take up less space, are more nutritious, and there are thousands to choose from.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBVXenVpfVM">The Blue Revolution</a>
        <p>Aqua-agriculture may be the future of humanity's food production.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs.html">FAQs About Overpopulation and Malthusianism</a>
        <p>Everything that was thought impossible, but was possible, only seemed impossible until it actually happened. The same applies to Overpopulation and Malthusianism.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html">FAQs About EPC And Reproduction Licenses</a>
        <p>Licenses are required to adopt children, so what's wrong with requiring licenses to have biological children? Requiring a license to have children is the simplest, most practical, and least authoritarian solution to reestablish positive selective pressures on the human genome.</p></li>

        <p>The Georgism movement used to be really popular during the Progressive Era from the 1880s to 1920s. However, the rising dominance of the automobile, mortgage loans, Keynesianism, and the Cold War era Capitalism-Communism dichotomy all contributed to the decline of Georgist activism. And now we have to endure a century's worth of successive mistakes.</p></li>
