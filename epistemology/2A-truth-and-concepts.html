<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-definition-of-concept">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A concept is anything or any idea that the human mind can think about.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every concept has an implicit (or explicit if more conscious) definition in our brains.</li>
<li>Every concept has a definition</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All properties are technically concepts by this definition since we can think about them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Properties are simpler concepts that can be identified as being parts of more complex concepts.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Properties are used to define complex concepts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Complex concepts may be defined by properties as part of their definition, and properties have their own definitions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So the definition of complex concepts that are defined by properties is really just a definition composed of other definitions.</li>
<li>If more complex concepts are described in simpler and simpler terms until there are no properties left to describe them, definitions that are free from properties are used instead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At some point, things just can&rsquo;t be more simply described, so definitions are used to communicate what our brains are indescribably and abstractly thinking about.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definitions have two purposes:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To explain things that we don&rsquo;t understand.</li>
<li>To provide concrete descriptions of what we are talking about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Every known concept and property has a definition in our brain, even if we can’t verbally describe it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Every concept has the property of certainty. There are (at least) four categories of epistemological certainty (the actual number will vary depending on the ontologies of the logic in question).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Impossible: There is no evidence to support a claim, concept, or idea.</li>
<li>Possible: There is a little evidence, but not much, to support a claim. If there no evidence to support a claim, then the claim is NOT possible.</li>
<li>Probable: There is a significant amount of evidence, enough to make the probability that something is true greater than the probability that it isn&rsquo;t true. Mathematically, there should be at least a 51% probability that it is true.</li>
<li>Certain: There is enough evidence to prove that something is true beyond a reasonable doubt (according to all our contextual knowledge).</li>
<li>Imaginary?: Imaginary concepts do not have to exist in reality.</li>

Top of the pyramid and human hierarchies visualized as discrete mathematical structures may imply that mathematics is embedded in metaphysics and even the human cognition to implicitly/unconsciously recognize the street mathematical structures in the metaphysics of the world.
After all why is a metaphor like top of the pyramid used to describe hierarchy or relationships among human societies one most people at the top of the hierarchy or not at the top of a pyramid, Storico context of Egyptian pharaohs living in pyramids or whatever.

<div id="outline-container-nested-definitions-of-knowledge" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="nested-definitions-of-knowledge"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> The Three Nested Definitions Of Knowledge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nested-definitions-of-knowledge">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The ability to predict (the ability to do the reasoning process).</li>
<li>The ability to do things (procedural knowledge).</li>
<li>The ability to fit form to function (FFF) (the most general definition of knowledge).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The most general definition is fit of form to function (FFF). We might say the flower knows how to attract bees. That&rsquo;s fit of form to function.
</p>

<p>
The procedural definition is the ability to do things. We might say he knows how to skate, he knows how to dance, he knows how to sink a 3-pointer or whatever. So those are the first two.
</p>

<p>
The most specific definition, is the ability to predict, and that&rsquo;s where you get into representations because prediction involves some way of representing reality. You can&rsquo;t talk about prediction until you have a representation scheme because what you&rsquo;re really doing when you predict is you&rsquo;re predicting information within some scheme based on other information in that scheme. So I would say there&rsquo;s no such thing as prediction without a model.
</p>

<p>
I would say that these three things are nested in the sense that the ability to predict enables you to do things, and the ability to do things is part of this more general biological concept of fitting a form to a function.
</p>

<p>
All three of these definitions imply that any acquired knowledge under any of these three definitions is ultimately aimed at solving problem.
</p>

<p>
A fourth definition of knowledge would be descriptive knowledge, which can be used to aid the actions of doing the procedural or prediction based definitions of knowledge, although it cannot be used to solve problems by itself alone.
</p>

<p>
Definition of predict: i
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The ability to predict things and the ability to do things are both pretty intuitive definitions of knowledge that don&rsquo;t require defining terms like truth, belief, or justified. Furthermore, the definition of prediction implies that prediction necessarily must be done based on given information within some scheme. Thus, defining knowledge as the ability to predict is not far removed from sensory experience. This definition of knowledge also doesn&rsquo;t conflict with any of the Gettier Problems.</li>
<li>Also, since the ability to predict implies: some sort of input (usually sense perception, but could also be a model or representation, or an imagined set of premises), concepts, and the logic process step, the ability to predict is basically the same thing as the reasoning process more or less, although &rsquo;predict&rsquo; might be restricted to some subset of purposes out of all the different purpose that the reasoning process could be directed towards.</li>
<li>The prediction-based definition is essentially the ability to do the Reasoning Process in specific contexts, or virtually any context (with the goal of solving a problem that the reason-endowed being chooses to solve).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Knowing how to fit a form to function is a good definition for knowledge because it is analogous to problem solving, but doesn&rsquo;t have to only be about problem-solving. It also seems related to pattern-matching.
</p>

<p>
All three of these definitions, including FFF are all <b>exactly</b> compatible with the definition of Narrow Artificial Intelligence (NIA).
</p>

<p>
Defining knowledge as FFF seems to go against the intuition that knowledge requires a brain or AI machine of some sort that knows the knowledge.
</p>

<p>
However, it is necessary that the FFF definition of knowledge goes against this intuition and is the broadest, most general definition of knowledge there is. The more specific definitions of knowledge are more complex, but they can both be defined in terms of the FFF definition of knowledge, which is ultimately a biological function, which makes sense since the goal of knowledge is to solve problems, and all problems are ultimately created by the existence of life.
</p>

<p>
Also, if someone knows some knowledge, but that knowledge cannot be used to do anything, shouldn&rsquo;t that still be considered knowledge? For example, comparative linguistics doesn&rsquo;t really solve any problems or benefit the human race in some way, although it could potentially supply some statistical knowledge of the likelihood of certain sound changes based on their historical frequency, and establishing all the different relations within various language families may aid the study of anthropology and population genetics.
</p>

<p>
Or better said, if a tree fell in the middle of the forest, does it matter? Would knowing the fact that the tree fell and when it fell count as knowledge, even if it cannot be used to make any conclusions?; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest</a>
</p>

<p>
However, if the knower doesn&rsquo;t perceive the knowledge to be useful or worth keeping, they are likely to forget that useless knowledge anyway since it would not improve their ability to reproduce, nor would it further their existence in some way. The brain is very much designed to not waste its energy or productiveness on things that it knows/thinks that it won&rsquo;t need.
</p>

<p>
What I am getting at here is that these definitions of knowledge seem to exclude descriptive knowledge (facts): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_knowledge">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_knowledge</a>
</p>


<p>
The AI Effect is very relevant here. Things that used to be considered AI like computer programs that can play Chess and more have a strong tendency to not be considered &ldquo;AI&rdquo; anymore, even though everybody would have considered the inventions of such things to be artificial intelligence before they were created. Likewise, we might not consider a flower that attracts many bees as having FFF knowledge of how to attract bees, but we might be more willing to consider such an ability to be knowledge before flowers were ever able to attract bees in the first place.
</p>

<p>
A General AI would basically be an AI that can do the entire human reasoning process, no matter what input it is taking in through its senses, and no matter what problems it is given to solve.
</p>

<p>
It isn&rsquo;t necessary or desirable to brainstorm a fourth definition of knowledge that is analogous to General AI, because a General AI would basically be capable of doing the prediction / reasoning process definition of knowledge within any context that it finds itself in. The problem with Narrow AI is precisely that NIA cannot function or solve any problems at all when feed input that it wasn&rsquo;t programmed to handle and/or when tasked with solving problems that it is incapable of solving.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that an AI necessarily has to be given problems to solve (and would want to solve if it has the capacity to desire doing actions or obtaining things), for the list of reasons below.
</p>

<p>
Just as Reason is useless in a world that is completely absent of problems, Knowledge would also be useless if there are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>No problems to solve,</li>
<li>No problems that can be solved, OR</li>
<li>No problems that the reason-endowed being wants/chooses to solve.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Criteria that problems must meet to be worth attempting to solve:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is a problem to solve,</li>
<li>It is possible to solve the problem, and</li>
<li>Some reason-endowed being would want/choose to solve the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This should make it very clear that the definition of knowledge should necessarily be related to the solving of problems somehow. What good is knowledge if there are no problems that it can, should, or would want to solve?

<p>
Important: If it&rsquo;s not possible for someone to know literally everything, then it&rsquo;s not possible for there to be a single universal ends-all-be-all fact-checker for truth.
</p>

<p>
The best way for truth and fact-checkers to work in a society would be for the most dominant fact-checkers to cite the primary expert/institution/authority/knowledge/facts that they appeal to when determining the truth value of something.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, there should be several competing truth fact-checkers, similar to how it&rsquo;s a good idea for there to be several competing products on the market, several competing currencies, or several competing reviewers/peer-reviewers. We&rsquo;ve already established that it&rsquo;s not possible for there to only be just one, so there has to be multiple ones. And it&rsquo;s up to everyone in society to decide who they want to agree with.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jLJczkOU44">What is Truth? - AntiCitizenX</a>
</p>

<p>
Although the video promotes the Pragmatist Theory of Truth in the last several minutes, this is misguided. If someone does not have enough information to make the best decision possible, they are <i>not</i> using the Pragmatist Theory of Truth to navigate themselves through life. What they are actually doing is they are using information compression to form the premises that are used in their decisions. Not everything that we gather about reality from our senses is the big picture of reality is. We often only have a very simplified understanding of reality for many different things.
</p>

<p>
We might make the wrong decisions because our understanding of reality isn&rsquo;t large enough, but it&rsquo;s better to say that when we do make mistakes, it&rsquo;s because the model of reality that we have in our minds is not comprehensive enough, not merely because we didn&rsquo;t know enough information about reality. Different truth judgments often result from people having levels of understanding and models of reality that vary by how detailed the models are.
</p>

<p>
Under this understanding of truth, the essential reason why &ldquo;objective truth&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist is because it&rsquo;s not possible to create a hypothetical model of reality that has 100% accurate precision for all its details.
Or in other words, it&rsquo;s not possible to be omniscient and know everything there is to know about reality because that is a fundamental condition of being a subject (philosophical).

In reality, there is no language associated with any objects or concepts. Language are a component of mental representations that make them easier to understand.
</p>

<p>
It always feels very interesting to think about concepts without language. It makes them feel more abstract and sometimes helps one think better.

Probably the term you&rsquo;re looking for is undecidable: we say a conjecture is undecidable, relative to some formal system, if neither it or its negation can be proven within that system.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it is possible to prove something undecidable, and it has been done (not with the Riemann hypothesis in particular, of course, but with other conjectures).

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Goodstein&rsquo;s theorem is not decidable in Peano arithmetic (though it is provable in ZFC set theory).</li>
<li>The continuum hypothesis is known to be undecidable in ZFC set theory. In 1940, Kurt Gödel proved that the continuum hypothesis cannot be refuted from the ZFC axioms; in 1963, Paul Cohen proved that it cannot be proven from those axioms either.</li>
<li>In fact, Gödel proved in 1931 that for any formal system rich enough to intepret Peano arithmetic, there is a proposition that cannot be proven or refuted in that system. Moreover his proof is constructive: for any system you devise that includes natural number arithmetic as we know it, I can give you a specific proposition that is undecidable in that system.</li>
