<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A concept is anything or any idea that the human mind can think about.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every concept has an implicit (or explicit if more conscious) definition in our brains.</li>
<li>Every concept has a definition</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All properties are technically concepts by this definition since we can think about them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Properties are simpler concepts that can be identified as being parts of more complex concepts.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Properties are used to define complex concepts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Complex concepts may be defined by properties as part of their definition, and properties have their own definitions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So the definition of complex concepts that are defined by properties is really just a definition composed of other definitions.</li>
<li>If more complex concepts are described in simpler and simpler terms until there are no properties left to describe them, definitions that are free from properties are used instead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At some point, things just can&rsquo;t be more simply described, so definitions are used to communicate what our brains are indescribably and abstractly thinking about.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definitions have two purposes:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To explain things that we don&rsquo;t understand.</li>
<li>To provide concrete descriptions of what we are talking about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Every known concept and property has a definition in our brain, even if we can’t verbally describe it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
True, False, Maybe are equivalent to Certain, Impossible, and Unknown/Possible, right?
</p>

<p>
Every concept has the property of certainty. There are (at least) four categories of epistemological certainty (the actual number will vary depending on the ontologies of the logic in question).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Impossible: There is no evidence to support a claim, concept, or idea.</li>
<li>Possible: There is a little evidence, but not much, to support a claim. If there no evidence to support a claim, then the claim is NOT possible.</li>
<li>Probable: There is a significant amount of evidence, enough to make the probability that something is true greater than the probability that it isn&rsquo;t true. Mathematically, there should be at least a 51% probability that it is true.</li>
<li>Certain: There is enough evidence to prove that something is true beyond a reasonable doubt (according to all our contextual knowledge).</li>
<li>Imaginary?: Imaginary concepts do not have to exist in reality.</li>
</ul>

This Entropy Theory of Information has many similarities to my prior recognition that the human comprehension of a priori (definition-based) is defined in terms of contrast of what things are with what they are not.

<h3 id="orgb9a4745"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Theory Of Mental Representation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Identify and incorporate your theory of Mental Representation into your epistemological philosophy.
</p>

<p>
Note in sense-perception file that all data sensed by vision is in the past to some extent, even if it is by a few nanoseconds. [The McCollough Effect]
</p>

<p>
In reality, there is no language associated with any objects or concepts. Language are a component of mental representations that make them easier to understand.
</p>

<p>
It always feels very interesting to think about concepts without language. It makes them feel more abstract and sometimes helps one think better.

<h3 id="org6748535"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Thinking About Summaries (Smaller Models Of Knowledge) Are Often More Important That Larger Ones</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
If someone spends literally decades of their life writing a Caro-esque biography or other work about somebody or something, the summarization of the work would definitely reach more minds than the actual several-thousands-pages-long work itself, because almost no one has enough time to read such a thing unless they were deeply interested in it or otherwise thought that they would get a lot of enjoyment/wisdom/understanding/etc out of it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb5b1a09" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb5b1a09"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Examples Of Influential, In-Depth Works That Are Hundreds Or Thousands Of Pages Long That Few People Read From Start To Finish</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s Critique of Pure Reason</li>
<li>Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s Critique of Practical Reason</li>
<li>Adam Smith&rsquo;s the Wealth of Nations</li>
<li>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engel&rsquo;s Das Kapital</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>Ted Kaczynski&rsquo;s Anti-Tech Revolution</li>
<li>Robert Caro&rsquo;s The Power Broker (1974), a biography of New York urban planner Robert Moses</li>
<li>Robert Caro&rsquo;s The Years of Lyndon Johnson, five volumes (1982, 1990, 2002, 2012, 202x)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For all of these works and many more, the synposes, summaries, and outlines that people have given about them have been spread to more people than the actual works themselves. It follows that anybody who wishes to write works of similar lengths should be very conscious about how the synopses would be interpreted by people. Furthermore, the authors of these works have all written about minor topics inside these books that were not the main topic of discussion, and consequently, these minor topics have been omitted from the books&rsquo; summaries, even though they were really important ideas (e.g. Smith&rsquo;s support for Land Value Tax based on ground rent, i, i)
</p>

<p>
i
</p>

<p>
Could a format be created where people could only read the parts of some work that they want to read / learn more on?
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, most people also won&rsquo;t read texts, especially really long ones, if they don&rsquo;t deem those texts to be worth reading in the first place. Aside from better understanding what the authors of those texts believed in, there&rsquo;s nothing to gain from reading them, and even then, fully understanding what person X believes is hardly worth it if most of their ideas are wrong to begin with, because there are infinitely many more ways to be wrong than there are to be correct. Some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is very little reason for anybody to read Karl Marx&rsquo;s Das Kapital because most of it has been rejected by mainstream economists and the Labor Theory of Value can be easily disproven and rejected in favor of Marginalism instead, which does correctly describe how prices work.</li>
<li>Although Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s analytic-synthetic distinction is novel, original, and an interesting idea to think about, it&rsquo;s not worth reading hundreds and hundreds of pages that elaborate on this idea with further conclusions because several premises that are encapsulated in the conceptual distinction are incorrect. However, there might/probably still be some more ideas worth thinking about in Kant&rsquo;s magnum opus, like his theory of characteristics (quantity, quality, etc) as shown in some outlines of his work.</li>
<li>Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s Critique of Practical Reason is not worth reading because it assumes that morality is objective, when morality is actually subjective.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So people will only spend dozens of hours reading a lengthy, extensive work if they already believe that it would be worth reading in the first place. Usually they will already agree with the claims and assertions presented within the texts&rsquo; summaries, in which case they would only be reading the books in order to better understand the specific ideas, arguments, and details.

<h3 id="org2991fe9"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Some Works Are Too Rigorous For Most People To Comprehend</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
As an example, most of the people who have attempted to read The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth report that they usually have to spend about 1-2 hours just to read 1-2 pages out of the entire volume of books which is approximately a thousand pages per book.
</p>

<p>
Of course, while Donald Knuth has spent literally years writing this volume, as well as years and decades of his life thinking about computer science and programming, his brain has been wired to deal with such complex mathematical rigor as it relates to algorithms, data structures, and solving computer science problems in general.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, say a CS grad/undergrad student who hopes to learn more deeply about computer science will not have their brain wired as deeply as the author who wrote the books to think about these kinds of problems. Hence, because the author is so advanced and esoteric in his thinking, what he writes is not easily understandable to a less experienced audience. Hence, other books and volumes written by different authors that are easier to understand thus become more popular and more widely read by people interested in these subjects.
