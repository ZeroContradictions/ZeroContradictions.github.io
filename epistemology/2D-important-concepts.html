<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-types-of-contradictions">
<p>
Although you already know the differences between all three of these, is it possible for you to draw some diagrams illustrating each of them, as well as diagrams showing how they relate to each other? Perhaps even diagrams showing cases where two of these concepts could be the same thing? (or maybe even show a case where all three of them can identify/generalize the same exact thing?)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An ordinary contradiction</li>
<li>A performative Contradiction</li>
<li>Circular reasoning (often a circle of contradictions)</li>
</ul>
<p>
It probably won&rsquo;t be necessary to write any rigorous epistemology theorem that arbitrary statements cannot be proven false. The epistemological framework that I am proposing does address arbitrary statements by asserting that they cannot be accepted as certain or possible unless there is at least some amount of evidence to designate it as &ldquo;possible&rdquo;. And although some people might claim that an abstract, ill-defined, and lengthy concept like God cannot be proven false, it actually can be proven false by either: 1. proving that the epistemic basis for believing God and the religion is ultimately a circular reasoning fallacy, and/or 2. letting all the contradictions pile up until there is no reasonable basis left to accept the concept.
</p>

<p>
Since knowledge is structured according to Empirically-Grounded Coherentism, this is the reason why the basis for rejecting ideologies or scientific propositions is to ultimately let more and more contradictions pile up until the believer chooses to reject the doctrine or ideas that they previously used to believe in.
</p>

<p>
People believe in whatever is coherent with the rest of the beliefs that they believe in, so if they&rsquo;re able to recognize enough contradictions between things that they definitively believe in and things that they less definitively believe in, they will eventually abandon the less definitive beliefs in order to stabilize their structure of beliefs to a point where they perceive their beliefs to be stable once again, whether or not they actually are or not in reality.

In philosophy, a razor is a principle or rule of thumb that allows one to eliminate (&ldquo;shave off&rdquo;) unlikely explanations for a phenomenon, or avoid unnecessary actions.[1][2][3] Razors include:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Occam&rsquo;s Razor: Simpler explanations are more likely to be correct; avoid unnecessary or improbable assumptions.</li>
<li>Hanlon&rsquo;s Razor: Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.</li>
<li>Hitchens&rsquo; Razor: What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.</li>
<li>Hume&rsquo;s Guillotine: What ought to be cannot be deduced from what is. &ldquo;If the cause, assigned for any effect, be not sufficient to produce it, we must either reject that cause, or add to it such qualities as will give it a just proportion to the effect.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Alder&rsquo;s Razor: If something cannot be settled by experiment or observation, then it is not worthy of debate.</li>
<li>Sagan Standard: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</li>
<li>Popper&rsquo;s Falsifiability Principle: For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be falsifiable.</li>
<li>Grice&rsquo;s Razor: As a principle of parsimony, conversational implications are to be preferred over semantic context for linguistic explanations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The primary goals of the philosophical razors are to figure out what can be quickly and summarily dismissed. The rationale behind this is to save time by not wasting it on things that are probably false and/or will lead towards dead-ends.
</p>

<p>
This rationale can be seen as a subcategory of rational ignorance. Although there might be knowledge to be gained by fully understanding and evaluating something that can be dismissed by a philosophical razor in greater depth, the costs of understanding the claims and arguments in question would exceed any benefits gained by understanding and evaluating those arguments. Most of the knowledge that would be gained from exploring the razor-dismissed arguments in greater depth would likely consist of understanding why the arguments are wrong, but this in time in greater detail, in comparison to why they can be summarily dismissed by the philosophical razors.

<h2 id="in-depth-works-most-people-never-finish"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Examples Of Influential, In-Depth Works That Are Hundreds Or Thousands Of Pages Long That Few People Read From Start To Finish</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-in-depth-works-most-people-never-finish">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s Critique of Pure Reason</li>
<li>Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s Critique of Practical Reason</li>
<li>Adam Smith&rsquo;s the Wealth of Nations</li>
<li>Karl Marx and Friedrich Engel&rsquo;s Das Kapital</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>Ted Kaczynski&rsquo;s Anti-Tech Revolution</li>
<li>Robert Caro&rsquo;s The Power Broker (1974), a biography of New York urban planner Robert Moses</li>
<li>Robert Caro&rsquo;s The Years of Lyndon Johnson, five volumes (1982, 1990, 2002, 2012, 202x)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For all of these works and many more, the synposes, summaries, and outlines that people have given about them have been spread to more people than the actual works themselves. It follows that anybody who wishes to write works of similar lengths should be very conscious about how the synopses would be interpreted by people. Furthermore, the authors of these works have all written about minor topics inside these books that were not the main topic of discussion, and consequently, these minor topics have been omitted from the books&rsquo; summaries, even though they were really important ideas (e.g. Smith&rsquo;s support for Land Value Tax based on ground rent, i, i)
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, most people also won&rsquo;t read texts, especially really long ones, if they don&rsquo;t deem those texts to be worth reading in the first place. Aside from better understanding what the authors of those texts believed in, there&rsquo;s nothing to gain from reading them, and even then, fully understanding what person X believes is hardly worth it if most of their ideas are wrong to begin with, because there are infinitely many more ways to be wrong than there are to be correct. Some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is very little reason for anybody to read Karl Marx&rsquo;s Das Kapital because most of it has been rejected by mainstream economists and the Labor Theory of Value can be easily disproven and rejected in favor of Marginalism instead, which does correctly describe how prices work.</li>
<li>Although Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s analytic-synthetic distinction is novel, original, and an interesting idea to think about, it&rsquo;s not worth reading hundreds and hundreds of pages that elaborate on this idea with further conclusions because several premises that are encapsulated in the conceptual distinction are incorrect. However, there might/probably still be some more ideas worth thinking about in Kant&rsquo;s magnum opus, like his theory of characteristics (quantity, quality, etc) as shown in some outlines of his work.</li>
<li>Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s Critique of Practical Reason is not worth reading because it assumes that morality is objective, when morality is actually subjective.</li>
</ul>
<p>
So people will only spend dozens of hours reading a lengthy, extensive work if they already believe that it would be worth reading in the first place. Usually they will already agree with the claims and assertions presented within the texts&rsquo; summaries, in which case they would only be reading the books in order to better understand the specific ideas, arguments, and details.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
If someone spends literally decades of their life writing a Caro-esque biography or other work about somebody or something, the summarization of the work would definitely reach more minds than the actual several-thousands-pages-long work itself, because almost no one has enough time to read such a thing unless they were deeply interested in it or otherwise thought that they would get a lot of enjoyment/wisdom/understanding/etc out of it.

<h3 id="org6daaebd"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> Some Works Are Too Rigorous For Most People To Comprehend</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
As an example, most of the people who have attempted to read The Art of Computer Programming by Donald Knuth report that they usually have to spend about 1-2 hours just to read 1-2 pages out of the entire volume of books which is approximately a thousand pages per book.
</p>

<p>
Of course, while Donald Knuth has spent literally years writing this volume, as well as years and decades of his life thinking about computer science and programming, his brain has been wired to deal with such complex mathematical rigor as it relates to algorithms, data structures, and solving computer science problems in general.
</p>

On the other hand, say a CS grad/undergrad student who hopes to learn more deeply about computer science will not have their brain wired as deeply as the author who wrote the books to think about these kinds of problems. Hence, because the author is so advanced and esoteric in his thinking, what he writes is not easily understandable to a less experienced audience. Hence, other books and volumes written by different authors that are easier to understand thus become more popular and more widely read by people interested in these subjects.
