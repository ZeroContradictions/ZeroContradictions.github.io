<h2 id="definitions"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Definitions Of Free Will</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-definitions">
<p>
Before we can even talk about this topic, we have to define some definitions for determinism and free will<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Determinism</dt><dd>The doctrine that all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will. Determinism is the lack of free will.</dd>
<dt>Free Will</dt><dd>The doctrine that humans are able to make decisions independently of external factors. In Zero Contradictions&rsquo;s philosophy, he defines four different types of free will.</dd>
<dt>Metaphysical Free Will (MFW)</dt><dd>Determinism is false (MFW is the opposite of determinism). This is essentially the same thing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_(metaphysics)">Libertarian Free Will</a>, which does not exist in reality, and can be disproven by proof by contradiction.</dd>
<dt>Subconscious Epistemic Free Will (SEFW)</dt><dd>The ability for you to <b>subconsciously choose</b> <b>something</b>, regardless of whether you can actually do it or not, and also regardless of whether determinism is true or false. Having subconscious choices is the exactly same thing as having needs, desires, or preferences. If SEFW exists, then value also exists. <i>All</i> sentient organisms have SEFW.</dd>
<dt>Conscious Epistemic Free Will (CEFW)</dt><dd>The ability for you to <b>consciously choose</b> to do what you want, regardless of whether you can actually do it or not, and also regardless of whether determinism is true or false. CEFW is more complex than SEFW since it requires more than just merely desiring things that would satisfy one&rsquo;s needs/desires. It also requires understandingly what exactly that you want, and knowing how to get it.</dd>
<dt>Attainable Free Will (AFW)</dt><dd>The two conditions that: 1. you can choose to do as you want, and 2. you are able to do it within your current circumstances. Since being conscious is a requirement in order to be &rsquo;capable&rsquo; of doing something, Attainable Free Will has to be conscious by definition, and it would be the case that Subconscious Attainable Free Will does not exist. Likewise,  Conscious Attainable Free Will is the exact same thing as AFW.</dd>
<dt>Volition</dt><dd>The same thing as Conscious Epistemic Free Will (CEFW).</dd>
</dl>

<div id="outline-container-definitions-clarifications" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="definitions-clarifications"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Clarifications On These Definitions Of Free Will</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-definitions-clarifications">
<p>
The keyword for Epistemic Free Will is <b>choose</b>. If an individual is merely capable of choosing to do what they want, then they have EFW.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Likewise, if an organism merely has &rsquo;desires&rsquo;, then they have EFW because &rsquo;desires&rsquo; are a form of choice, even if the desires are subconscious.</li>
<li>When we typically think about &rsquo;choices&rsquo; and the ability to choose, we typically think about making choices that we are consciously aware of, but they don&rsquo;t always have to be conscious choices (in which case they would be desires because desires are defined as unconscious choices).</li>
<li>Thus, in order for an individual to not have EFW, they would not only have to be incapable of making conscious choices, but they would also have to be incapable of having any desires.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Free will (doing as you please) exists on a spectrum of determinism and free will, which would be especially implied by the fact that certain hormone levels are required to achieve free will.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free will is defined as being able to do the things that you want to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although SEFW, CEFW, and AFW do exist, it&rsquo;s possible for a sentient organism to not have CEFW or to neither have CEFW nor AFW. Examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An individual is unconscious or only subconscious, so they don&rsquo;t have CEFW or AFW, even though they may have desires.</li>
<li>An individual is conscious but unable to do what they want, so they don&rsquo;t have AFW.</li>
<li>An individual is paralyzed, so they don&rsquo;t have AFW, even though they may have desires may be conscious.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-examples-of-SEFW" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="examples-of-SEFW"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Example Desires That Are Acts Of SEFW</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-examples-of-SEFW">
<p>
In some languages, the verb that means &ldquo;to desire/want&rdquo; is exactly the same as the verb that means &ldquo;to choose&rdquo;. The reason why I make a distinction between CEFW and SEFW is to distinguish between these two similar yet different shades of meaning (&ldquo;to want&rdquo; vs &ldquo;to choose&rdquo;).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I don&rsquo;t want to feel pain.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want to be hungry.</li>
<li>I want to be happy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since SEFW requires sentient organisms, a universe without sentient life is also a universe without SEFW (and also without CEFW and AFW by implication).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-definitions-summary" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="definitions-summary"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Summary Of These Definitions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-definitions-summary">
<p>
In the simplest of words, these different definitions of free will can be summed up in the following stages:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>MFW: The metaphysically contradictory definition</li>
<li>SEFW: Having subconscious desires</li>
<li>CEFW: Having desires and knowing how to fulfill them</li>
<li>AFW: Having desires, knowing how to fulfill them, and being able to fulfill them</li>
</ul>
<p>
The definition of free will that most people think about when they hear &ldquo;free will&rdquo; (and don&rsquo;t clearly define what they&rsquo;re talking about) is Metaphysical Free Will (the first definition), which is the opposite of Hard Determinism.

<h2 id="determinism-vs-freedom"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Determinism Versus Freedom</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-determinism-vs-freedom">
<p>
It is not necessary to acquire any more proof that free will doesn&rsquo;t exist, because true freedom cannot exist:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Suggesting there&rsquo;s free will in a cause-and-effect universe is like saying there&rsquo;s &ldquo;triangular roundness&rdquo;. (Free will and Determinism are mutually contradictory and incompatible)</li>
<li>Suggesting the universe isn&rsquo;t cause-and-effect, requires that a non-cause could &ldquo;cause something&rdquo;. (How could something happen if it wasn&rsquo;t caused to happen?)</li>
<li>Suggesting the universe isn&rsquo;t deterministic but random means &ldquo;randomness&rdquo; determines the outcome of the universe. Randomness is a completely broken piece of rhetoric, because even granting its veracity still means &ldquo;randomness&rdquo; is determining outcome, and since that still means outcome is being determined then it&rsquo;s still deterministic)</li>
</ol>
<p>
An objective thinker must understand what constitutes &ldquo;broken semantics&rdquo;, &ldquo;logical incoherence&rdquo;, &ldquo;closed concepts&rdquo; and &ldquo;impossibility&rdquo;. Then the model of reality can always be put together, and eventually completely put together, regardless of all junk data &#x2013; the many forms of junk data in the world.
</p>

<p>
Evidently, here are the most popular junk data conclusions in the world, aside from the delusion of divinity:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>That the case for reality can only be left hanging in uncertainty.</li>
<li>That everything boils down to subjective perspective.</li>
<li>That nothing ever matters.</li>
<li>That the universe, existence and life will continue forever.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are only two reasons why anybody would ever (purposely) do anything in their life:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They want to.</li>
<li>They are forced to.</li>
<li>They did it accidentally (but of course, nobody would argue that free will existed here anyway).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="MFW-performative-contradiction"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Why It Is A Performative Contradiction To Believe That People Can Have Free Will Independent Of Their Materialistic Minds</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-MFW-performative-contradiction">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Given that we live in a deterministic universe and we obviously already know what it&rsquo;s like to live in one, what would a non-deterministic universe be like to live in?</li>
<li>By definition, this would mean that life would have free will that is not bound to how its DNA or brains are programmed.</li>
<li>Free will only concerns life. In our materialistic universe, life is matter that was created with the perfect mix of chemicals to be able to do all its functions and behave the way it does.</li>
<li>In other words, in an idealist universe, it would be possible to create something that behaves just as life does in our universe, but is able to also not behave as life does in our universe.</li>
<li>Such a concept would probably be deserving of a different word other than &ldquo;life&rdquo;. Perhaps it could be &ldquo;frilife&rdquo; (meaning free-will life).</li>
<li>The minds of frilife would be able to act independently of how they are materialistically structured. No matter what structure frilife has, it would be acting independently according to how some supernatural force desires.</li>
<li>The structure of the minds of frilife would therefore be completely useless and irrelevant (aside from sending signals throughout the body necessary to maintain basic life-sustaining processes like temperature regulation, pain, senses, et cetera).</li>
<li>But there&rsquo;s a problem. If frilife was acting independently to how its mind is structured, what else would it be controlled by to decide how it should behave and function? Another materialistic structure? No, because the premises rule that out as impossible. And there is no other known force in the universe that could make it act independently of its structure. In conclusion (according to everything we currently know obviously), frilife is impossible because it creates a metaphysical contradiction.</li>
<li>By trying to imagine such as a concept, the text above collectively forms a Proof by Contradiction. Though it was unintentional to write a proof, this is a very interesting proof.</li>
<li>Likewise, this is why religious people are able to believe that free will exists. They make the mistake of imagining a supernatural power that would make it the case that the contradiction above never exists, thus free will would be able to exist. But the reality is that this is not the case because they assumed a false premise in the first place.</li>

<h2 id="determinism-parents-and-children"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> The Deterministic Effects That Parents Have Over Their Children</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-determinism-parents-and-children">
<p>
The point of this list is to demonstrate that no one ever has any Epistemic Free Will over the circumstances that they grew up with. When parents decide to have children, they effectively have the power to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Choose where the children live, and in what conditions</li>
<li>Choose the native language(s) that the children speak, and potentially also their second language(s) too.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This indirectly affects which people the children can make friends with, their economic and educational opportunities, and the media that they can access</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Choose what the children eat (since they are the ones with the responsibility to feed them)</li>
<li>Choose the children&rsquo;s education</li>
<li>Indoctrinate the children with their beliefs, including religion, politics, and other cults</li>
<li>Choose the activities that the children do</li>
<li>Choose the children&rsquo;s names</li>
<li>Choose how many siblings the children have, and extend their family histories to the children</li>
<li>Inseminate the children with whatever genes they have, which can affect things including but not limited to: the children&rsquo;s interests, the children&rsquo;s intelligence, the children&rsquo;s looks, the children&rsquo;s physical condition, and the children&rsquo;s quality of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When parents have the power to raise their children however they want, they could easily trap those children in a box, and they would never be able to escape until they become adults.

[This section is unfinished]
</p>

<p>
This is best understood through the concept of &rsquo;spatiotemporal envelopes&rsquo;, which are defined as time intervals of various defined lengths through which prior events affect posterior events or chains of sequential posterior events across the designated three-dimensional space and time. Spatiotemporal envelopes may overlap each other, and shorter consecutive spatiotemporal envelopes can be merged to form longer ones.
</p>

<p>
Every individual is endowed with a spatiotemporal envelope that comprises their entire life Every individual is endowed with a spatiotemporal envelope that comprises their entire life through which they had, have, and/or will have affected their environment and the people around them.
</p>

<p>
Since history and the universe are characterized by chains of cause-and-effect events, so if we can understand the past background, events, and life experiences that made each of us who we all are, then we can &#x2026;

Due to the metaphysical nature of the universe, history is characterized by cause-and-effect, so if we can understand the past, background, events, and life experiences that made each of us who we are by taking a survey and/or assessment of each &#x2026;

&ldquo;Choice&rdquo; does not have to be arbitrary. In principle, if you somehow knew absolutely everything there was to know about the current state of the world, it is possible that you would be able to predict everyone&rsquo;s choices in the future with 100% accuracy - but they still remain choices. They may be predetermined on a very fundamental level, but for practical purposes it does not make a lot of difference whether you assume them to be predetermined or not.
</p>

<p>
Mathematics has a very interesting branch called &ldquo;chaos theory&rdquo;. What is studied there are models in which small variations in initial conditions lead to dramatic changes in the outcomes. There is a good reason to believe that the Universe as a whole is fairly chaotic; the &ldquo;butterfly effect&rdquo; seems to be quite real.
</p>

<p>
What this implies is that it is extremely hard, if not altogether impossible, to predict choices people will make in the future. When I go to the store tomorrow, will I buy a bottle of wine or not? So many minor factors may affect this choice that the best you can hope to do in the foreseeable future is to give a very-very rough probabilistic estimate of the chances of me doing that.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you build a very simple general intelligence AI that has the ability to self-learn and modify its own code. The initial code may be very simple, and you might even be able to memorize it in the extreme case - yet, once you launch the AI, just a few seconds later its code will likely become completely unrecognizable and incomprehensible to you. Even though this AI was specifically pre-programmed by you, its choices are still virtually unpredictable.
</p>

<p>
To me, it does not matter whether &ldquo;true&rdquo; free will exists; I believe that it does not and, furthermore, it cannot logically, but that is not very important. What is important is that people&rsquo;s will is free in that chaotic sense outlined above. If choices cannot be accurately predicted in practice, then they might as well be considered free in the true, fundamental, sense as far as practical considerations go.
</p>

<p>
And people certainly should be held accountable for their non-coerced choices. If I murder someone, then I hardly can appeal to determinism to claim that I could not help it and became a victim of some grand mechanism no one has any control over; it was still me murdering someone in peaceful circumstances. It was still me violating their rights.
</p>

<p>
Although it is practical in most cases to pretend that metaphysical free will exists even though it doesn&rsquo;t exist in any form at all, this pretending should NOT be done in all cases, especially ones where the problems to be solved require acknowledging the non-existence of MFW, such as resolving abnormalities in neurological structures that cause things like OCD, dementia, etc.
</p>

<p>
Thought on Statistics: If the universe is deterministic and eternalism is correct, then the purpose of statistics is just to predict the course that determinism will take. Regardless of what happens, everything will be known in the future after the events are over, provided that the information was recorded somehow for future generations to see and decipher.

The noun phrase &ldquo;Free Will&rdquo; tends to be categorized more often as an epistemological concept, whereas determinism is seen more as a metaphysical concept. But &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; is a rather misleading concept to begin with since it leads people into believing in Platonism, for which there isn&rsquo;t very strong evidence to support.

Technically, Hard Determinism is not the same thing as Materialistic Physicalism. It&rsquo;s possible to be a hard determinist <i>and</i> devoutly religious at the same time, as some religious and superstitious people believe that nobody has any free will because everybody&rsquo;s actions are ultimately determined by some God. Such people are not materialists or physicalists, so that&rsquo;s an example of how Hard Determinism and Materialistic Physicalism are not necessarily the same thing. I&rsquo;ve added this footnote because I had previously never thought of this.
