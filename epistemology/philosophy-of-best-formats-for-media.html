Note: I haven&rsquo;t finished writing this file yet.
</p>

<p>
On my philosophy reading list, I still need to read Chapters 16, 17, 18, and 19 of Teaching by Principles. Once I finish reading those chapters, it will give me more knowledge and greater insight into improving this web page.

<h2 id="orged2a94c"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Differences And Advantages To Various Formats</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Would it be possible to create a format / medium that enables people to reap both the benefits of watching a movie and reading a book at the same time?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Movies and visual mediums have the advantage of being visual for showing what&rsquo;s going on and what everything looks like.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They also feature music that sets the tone for many different scenes.</li>
<li>They have shorter lengths of time.</li>
<li>Their greatest disadvantage is that they take more time to produce.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reading and textual mediums have the advantage of showing what the characters are thinking about.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They are often times better for explaining some types of information, especially really dense ones that wouldn&rsquo;t fit into a fast-paced visual format.</li>
<li>Books are often better than movies since they focus on telling a story instead of portraying visual effects. There are so many expensive movies that had terrible, boring plots.</li>
<li>The reader is free to imagine what everything looks like, which could potentially be more entertaining.</li>
<li>The reader could choose their own music to listen to for setting the tone. However, the quality would depend on their ability to select the right music for the appropriate scenes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Other Differences
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Books are also available in audio formats, which can give them an advantage over movies which are strictly visual.</li>
<li>There are few bad books out there out of the best ones to read.</li>
<li>Books tend to use more complicated language that would require dictionaries to understand.</li>
<li>They are much cheaper to produce and purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Said format could feature music playing to set the tone at all times.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It could be mainly visual, but display what the characters are thinking for short snippets.</li>
<li>This might be very hard to do since it might feel weird to switch back and forth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Personally, I don&rsquo;t think 3D movies are worth the price (neurodivergence should be taken into account). Sometimes they cause motion sickness, the glasses don&rsquo;t fit well, they cost more, and I generally don&rsquo;t notice any difference between them and the 2D versions. In the end, I only memorize the plot and the action, not the 3D visual effects which I don&rsquo;t remember at all after just a few days.</li>
<li>i</li>

</ul>

<p>
The best academic works are the ones that teach the greatest amount of information in the shortest length.
</p>

<p>
Maybe one of the reasons why there are so many different formats for learning something (textbooks, webpages, lectures, interactive activities, learn by doing) even though some ways are probably better than others on average is because human comprehension is so low. Since human comprehension after learning something is low in general, it is hard to measure which learning methods work and which ones don&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>
Although repeating ideas in a written work is often viewed as a bad thing, sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary in order to firmly get the point across. This is the case for the groundedlibertarian.com and Larken Rose&rsquo;s The Most Dangerous Superstition (for the point and ideas the author is trying to convey, even though it is extremely flawed). The average human has a low comprehension rate around ~60%, so another reason why it might be necessary to repeat ideas is so that they don&rsquo;t forget them.
</p>

<p>
Sign language and oral/written language is analogous to analog and digital. Even though digital technology has more advantages than analog technology, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that analog doesn&rsquo;t have any advantages over digital.
</p>

<p>
Although being able to type faster is definitely useful, it often doesn&rsquo;t make programming, writing musings, etc. faster.
Law: If amount-to-be-typed &gt; typing-speed, then faster typing speed is beneficial
</p>

<p>
Audio presentations and podcasts are linear (one-way) audio streams organized in a coherent structure designed for human comprehension.

<h2 id="org2c3417b"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Written Debates Are Superior To In-Person Debates (IMO)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The nature of debates is that they are used to settle disagreements on topics.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Part of the nature of winning a debate is that it relies on being able to give the right arguments on the fly at the perfect time.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes one side will have the better position, but they are able to defend it well since they don&rsquo;t have the right facts at the right time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most stand-up debates usually feature political discussions, and they have no value because a lot of it is just pandering to different groups of people, the debaters tend to be of average intelligence, and the debaters of ignorant of evolutionary theory, human nature, economics, etc.</li>
<li>The only other field that would have any topics worth debating about is the greater field of philosophy, but most issues in philosophy would be resolved by reason and science.</li>
<li>Furthermore, in debates there often aren&rsquo;t any sources to check facts, and if there are sources provided, there are usually no resources to check the validity of the sources.</li>
<li>Stand-up debates are never done in academia (excluding &ldquo;science&rdquo;), which hints at the futility of debates.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Academia settles disagreements through research, reason, and documents, papers, and other media featuring research and reason.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Written mediums are the best way to debate. There is enough time for both sides to gather the research, reason, facts, and evidence to support their positions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The important thing is to know how to argue and reason well. This skill is better than any other debating techniques.</li>
<li>Opposing sides cannot interrupt each other, which is a bonus.</li>
<li>Since written mediums they are not in-person, they also get less personal, which is good for avoiding personal conflicts</li>
<li>Issues external to the debate topics such as speaker appearance, perceived confidence, intonation, and body language can interfere with the validity of the speakers&rsquo; positions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In written mediums, these external factors are not present, so the content can be judged as it is by itself.</li>
<li>The only external factor present in written mediums is how well the content is written, but given as much time as one needs, this can be perfected to eliminate the bias.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, the need for spoken debates will inevitably arise when people converse, so even though spoken debates are an inferior debating format, they still hold importance in being inevitable and essential for trying to convince someone in the spur of the moment.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thus, it is still important to have at least some experience with a spoken debate as a tool of persuasion and social skills.</li>
<li>A characteristic feature of cults is that they quote their authority-figures / leaders instead of explaining their beliefs when it gets difficult. It&rsquo;s the same thing that sends people away from religion. Why explain your beliefs when you could just quote the bible?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org6cd285d"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Disadvantages Of GUI&rsquo;s</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You have to figure out what all the buttons do (if its not immediately obvious)</li>
<li>You have to memorize where all the buttons are</li>
<li>You often have to click several times to get to the buttons</li>
<li>It is less flexible in its options</li>
<li>It requires more system resources</li>
</ul>

<p>
Maybe the best formats would use color codes to indicate how the reader should read the following text (e.g. read it like a paragraph, read it carefully, just skim the list and think about it a little, don&rsquo;t forget this, main point, etc)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;there is a list of what the next following sections will be&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;there is a list of what the next following sections will be, and each of those subsections will contain their own subsections too (sub-subsections)&rdquo;</li>

<h2 id="orgddc7a62"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> More Thoughts On Best Formats For Media</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A lot of books have their content primarily consist on making the implicit explicit. I&rsquo;ve written before somewhere else in my files about the difference between knowing subjects and knowing their finer, more specific details about <i>how they work</i>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Perhaps what&rsquo;s implicit and not implicit to people depends on the person.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Books can also teach us how do to things that we didn&rsquo;t already implicitly know, such as mathematical techniques/procedures, complicated definitions (not obvious definitions), facts/premises, reasoning, conclusions, etc.</li>
<li>And in the worst case scenario, they can either teach us false information or information that we already know.</li>

<li>Complete references are better uesd as supplementary learning material instead of ascending beginner-to-advanced learning material.</li>

<li>Another advantage to books is that they can be as long as the author likes. Movies on the other hand generally cannot be more than two or even three hours long.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The Diátaxis framework aims to solve the problem of structure in technical documentation. It adopts a systematic approach to understanding the needs of documentation users in their cycle of interaction with a product.
</p>

<p>
Diátaxis identifies four modes of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. It derives its structure from the relationship between them.
</p>

<p>
In Diátaxis, each of these modes (or types) answers to a different user need, fulfils a different purpose and requires a different approach to its creation.
