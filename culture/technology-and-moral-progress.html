<h2 id="technology-creates-illusion"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Moral Progress Is Largely Caused Only By Technology</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-technology-creates-illusion">
<p>
Without technology, we wouldn&rsquo;t have seen any improvements in material conditions for humans, and likewise there would never be any such collective illusion of moral progress among the public. At the same time, humans only started to care about moral progress when they stopped being focused on just merely surviving 24/7, something that has only been made possible by the advent of technology. A human who is focused on survival 24/7 would never have any time to think nor care about what&rsquo;s moral because they&rsquo;re only focused on what helps them survive, as well as what helps their community survive since the community aids the survival.
</p>

<p>
Given that the invention of technology made it possible for humans to not have to think about survival 24-7, this made it possible for humans to start thinking about morality because they now had extra time on their hands to think about how and why they should live their lives. Before then, it was impossible for humans to think about morality because they never had any time to think about it since they were necessarily concerned for survival and reproduction instead. If it was not possible for humans to think about morality before the advent of technology, then they cannot be faulted for doing things that most people today would consider to be immoral.
</p>

<p>
So to summarize, technology caused humans to start consciously thinking about morals beyond just human survival by giving humans more free time to focus on things not related to survival. Eventually, technology caused the growth and settlement of human populations which necessitated structured human societies that established law and order. Along with that and newer religions, the illusion of moral progress was further enhanced. In today&rsquo;s world, the illusion of moral progress is at its greatest and most pervasive extent ever because:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Technology has significantly improved material conditions in order to abandon things that violate ethical intuitions like slavery, monarchical rule, rape, et cetera,</li>
<li>Culture, mass education, and mass media have all reinforced the instillation of collective morality onto the public, and</li>
<li>The necessity for humans to engage in the power process, but the inability to do so by natural means in a technologically-advanced world compels people (leftists especially) to devote their time to prattling about social causes that they believe in to give them some sort of objective to strive towards (even though accomplishing this objective would subsequently force them to find something else to do in this world if there was no more virtue-signaling that could be done about anything).</li>
</ol>
<p>
So not only has technology made it possible for humans to think about morality beyond their own selfish desires for survival, but technology has also made both the illusions of moral progress and objective morality possible as well.
</p>

<p>
Of course, there have been thousands of prehistorical human religions, but without further knowledge about anthropology, it is difficult to say to what extent any of those religions directed any thought about moral progress, if any.
</p>

<p>
If determinism is true and humans don&rsquo;t truly have free will, then how could any real moral progress ever truly happen? Steven Pinker doesn&rsquo;t talk specifically or coherently about this disconnect between like the determinism that he supposedly believes and then just his assumption that moral progress is happening.
</p>

<p>
The closest thing there&rsquo;s ever been to moral progress has been the elimination of war, disease, and famine, followed by the subsequent recognition of individual rights during modernity. Since the illusion of moral progress has been driven by improvements in material conditions, this suggests that the &ldquo;best&rdquo; morality should be structured around the best practices that further strengthen the material conditions of humans. This thus makes a sound justification for adopting cooperationist ethics.

<h3 id="historical-progress"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Historical Examples Of How Moral Progress Has Only Been Improvements In Material Conditions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-historical-progress">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It became both economically feasible and desirable to eliminate Slavery due to the advancement of machines that could: pick cotton instead, make textiles, (anything else?)</li>
<li>The decline of child labor was largely caused by machines that could do labor more efficiently instead, although changing public attitudes and spread of public education likely contributed to this as well to lesser extents.</li>
<li>The abundance of commodities in modern times due to industrialization has made it possible for more people than ever to not have to live in abject poverty.</li>
<li>The widespread adoption of vaccines and modern medicine has made it possible to eradicate many diseases that have historically plagued human societies.</li>
<li>In modern post-WWII times, war has been quite uncommon compared to its historical presence, but this has only been made possible due to the establishment of improved living conditions around the world (thus reducing the need to compete for resources worldwide), free trade (which reduces conflicts between nations), and the intense favorability to avoid the gruesome potential for destruction and nuclear war that has never been seen before.</li>
<li>Modern contraception and birth control made it possible to not have children born into undesirable conditions.</li>
<li>The automobile relieved the pressure on land values and land rent by making it possible for people to move out of the cities and into the suburbs, although this has only been a temporary fix since the core problem has yet to be resolved by universal LVT.</li>

<h3 id="illusions-in-moralist-communities"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Changes/Possibilities/Examples Enabled By Technology That Various Moralist Communities Would Claim To Be &ldquo;Moral Progress&rdquo; According To Their Perceptions Of The World</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-illusions-in-moralist-communities">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Vegan diets only being made possible since humans don&rsquo;t rely on hunting and gathering anymore, clothing made from plants or plant materials instead of animal hides and fabrics, et cetera (according to vegans&rsquo; perspectives).</li>
<li>Gender reassignment surgeries / sex change operations / hormone therapies that make it possible for gender dysphoric people to change their bodies to be more like the opposite sex and less like the biological sex that they were born to.</li>
<li>Dating websites and dating apps have made it easier than ever for homosexuals and bisexuals to find a partner, and they are now the leading method for finding a partner in many parts of the world.</li>
<li>Anti-natalists view contraception and abortion as some of the most important technological inventions ever.</li>
<li>Capitalists view technology favorably because technology has caused capitalism to progress and improve people&rsquo;s standard of living.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-ideologies-future-progress" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="ideologies-future-progress"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Examples Where Utopian Ideologies Believe That Future Moral Progress Can Be Made By Technological Improvements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ideologies-future-progress">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The technological ability to create synthetic pills that could supply humans with necessary vitamins and minerals that can only be found in animals and not plants (some nutrition-conscious vegans have argued that this should replace eating animal products as the way to acquire those nutrients for humans and other necessarily omnivorous species).</li>
<li>Ancaps often argue that their fantasy worlds will have amazing technologies like seasteading, blockchains, and more that will enable them to live in a super &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; utopia that has never been seen before. But if new/innovative technologies are necessary to make such utopias possible, then hypothetical &ldquo;moral improvements&rdquo; like the kinds alluded to by ancaps are only made possible by advancing technologies, as it has always been the case.</li>
<li>Efilists believe that humanity should destroy the Earth and render it uninhabitable for all sentient life, but this never would have been possible in previous eras because the necessary technology for accomplishing this goal never existed prior to modernity.</li>

<div id="outline-container-moral-progress-without-tech" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="moral-progress-without-tech"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Historical Examples Of &ldquo;Moral Progress&rdquo; That Weren&rsquo;t Caused By Advancing Technology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-moral-progress-without-tech">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The replacement of monarchies by democracies.</li>
<li>The abolition of many cruel punishments.</li>
<li>The progression of human rights (e.g. freedom of expression, right to fair trial, etc).</li>
<li>The decline of religious persecution, racial segregation, racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, ableism, etc.</li>
<li>The decline of European colonialism (it became too expensive to rule overseas colonies, and the local populations began protesting and fighting for independence). It should be noted however that European colonialism seems to have been mostly beneficial in most (but not all) cases since technologies caused declines in infant mortality rates, starvation, diseases, and other factors that have limited the local populations.</li>
<li>i</li>
</ul>
<p>
Interestingly, anarcho-primitivists are some of the few people who would actually argue that the progression of technology has actually caused a significant regression in moral progress, whereas virtually everyone else enthusiastically views technology as a way to continue &ldquo;moral progress&rdquo;. Besides anarcho-primitivists, some of the most extreme communists and socialists might would believe that humanity has not made much if any moral progress since they hate capitalism so much, even though capitalism has been largely beneficial for humanity.
