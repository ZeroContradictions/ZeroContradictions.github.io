<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-moralit-is-relative">
<p>
Post-moralism is the philosophical position that game theory is the best way to understand morality. Post-moralism is similar to moral relativism in that it proposes that morality can only be perspective-dependent, but it&rsquo;s different since it also embraces selfishness and rationality, both of which are always assumptions for the actors of game-theoretic problems.
</p>

<p>
It is valuable to one&rsquo;s cognitive understanding to find multiple different ways to prove the same thing, since each method can reveal something new or showcase powerful intuitions for why the conclusion is correct and <a href="../epistemology/1D-empirically-grounded-coherentism.html">builds coherence within one&rsquo;s belief system</a>.
</p>

<p>
When someone has a fallacious and/or inconsistent belief system, finding different ways to prove the same conclusion is also essential for helping the necessary amount of contradictions build up in the believer&rsquo;s mind, so that they can ultimately reject their previous, fallacious beliefs.
</p>

<p>
This is a list of ways for proving that morality is relative / subjective:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The most direct and straight-forward way of proving that morality is subjective is to start by showing that all value is subjective and that morality is necessarily based on value. Since morality is based on value, and all value is subjective, morality also has to be subjective. Objective value is an oxymoron because all value is perspective-dependent, but &ldquo;objective&rdquo; means perspective-independent. Objective value does not exist (because it can&rsquo;t), so objective morality doesn&rsquo;t exist either.</li>
<li>Morality cannot progress anyways because most so-called &ldquo;moral progress&rdquo; is actually improvements in technology and the standard of living. The main reason why slavery ended was because machines were invented that could do the labor instead. Slavery would still be legal today if it wasn&rsquo;t for the Industrial Revolution, for the same reason why the Founding Fathers of the United States owned slaves themselves despite disliking the idea of slavery. If it never became possible to replace slave labor with machines and people who worked over 80 hours a week (before labor unions and further technological advancement/automation), the same moral attitude held by the Founding Fathers would still persist to this day because slavery would still be necessary to do all the labor without the availability of machines.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since free trade can help prevent war, it must be acknowledged that technology was needed to facilitate free trade like the steam engine (and more sophisticated engines later on), shipping container, man-made Suez and Panama Canals, and more have made it easier to facilitate free trade which prevents the likelihood of war since the mid-20th century.</li>
<li>NOTE: Although &ldquo;moral progress&rdquo; is strongly correlated with technological progress, it is still the case that technological progress and the mostly &ldquo;good&rdquo; things that it can accomplish can still improve human societies in ways that are pleasing to nearly everyone&rsquo;s subjective moral preferences.</li>
<li>See <a href="./technology-and-moral-progress.html">this post</a> for more details.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How can there ever be any true &ldquo;moral progress&rdquo; when virtually all &ldquo;moral progress&rdquo; can, is, or will only be made possible by technological improvements? If the technology that caused the moral improvements was historically absent for most of human history, how could previous human societies have been moral if it wasn&rsquo;t technologically possible for them to be moral?</li>
<li>Even today, there are people like Anarcho-Capitalists who argue that their fantasy worlds will have amazing technologies like sea-steading, blockchains, and more that will enable them to live in a super &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; utopia that has never been seen before. But if new/innovative technologies are necessary to make such utopias possible, then hypothetical &ldquo;moral improvements&rdquo; like the kinds alluded to by AnCaps are only made possible by advancing technologies, as it has always been the case. (I can give you some more examples if you&rsquo;d like about how most moral progress is really only technological progress)</li>
<li>Life is a zero-sum game. Whether it be competition for energy and resources, competition for mates and reproducing offspring, or competition for virtually anything else, life is ultimately a game of competition between selfish individuals striving to accomplish their own goals and objectives. Everybody may want to win, but not everybody can win at life because for every winner, there will be a loser. Whether moral objectivists accept it or not, picking the winners and losers of life is completely subjective.</li>
<li>Most people would believe that there are at least some situations where it is immoral to force someone else to conform to your own morality. This suggests that morality is not objective.</li>
<li>Although Mathematics is always enforced by reality without the help of moral agents, morality is not enforced by the material world under any circumstances, and it must necessarily be enforced by moral agents who decide to enforce it however THEY want to do so.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If everybody chooses not to follow the objective morality, then nobody will follow it. And if nobody chooses to enforce the objective morality, then the objective morality will not be enforced at all.</li>
<li>On the other hand, it is NOT optional to obey mathematics, unlike morality. Those who attempt to manipulate the universe in some way by making the wrong mathematical calculations (or even no calculations at all) to inform their decisions will necessarily face the consequences of their actions due to their failure to make and be informed by the right mathematical calculations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reason is incapable of determining objective morality. Since value and the prioritization of values is subjective, it is impossible for reason to objectively determine which values should be prioritized over others. If moral values cannot be objectively prioritized, objective morality cannot exist.</li>
<li><p>
If morality was supposedly objective then why has it made the least amount of progress compared to all the other sciences and fields of human knowledge? It is undeniable that a moral objectivist would have to agree that most of the world does not follow the supposedly objective moral standard that they claim to exist, since most of the world is divided by religion, state and legal institutions, and cultural philosophies/ethics. This does not decisively prove that morality is not objective, but it is still additional evidence to prove the point that morality is subjective nonetheless. One should also recognize that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral&rdquo; in one time period is not moral in a later one.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral&rdquo; in one culture is not moral in another.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral&rdquo; to one moral agent is not moral to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It doesn&rsquo;t seem coincidental that nobody can agree on what objective morality is.
</p></li>
<li>Game Theory is excellent for demonstrating how morality depends on perspective.</li>
<li>If determinism is true and humans don&rsquo;t truly have free will, then how could any real moral progress ever truly happen if everything in the past and future were/are determined to happen?</li>
<li>Although Ayn Rand wrote that rationalizing is anti-virtuous and irrational thing to do, this statement condemning rationalization is only true when not dealing with ethics. Just about everyone will rationalize their existence if necessary because humans and animals alike all evolved to do that. Rationalizing is not anti-virtuous, it is part of nature, on principle of selfish genes and egoism.</li>
<li><p>
So Sam Harris argues that the only viable moral framework for an objective &ldquo;science of morality&rdquo; is one where &ldquo;morally good&rdquo; things pertain to increases in the &ldquo;well-being of conscious creatures&rdquo; (he should have written &ldquo;sentient&rdquo; creatures instead, because morality applies to sentient beings just as much as conscious ones).
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>HOWEVER, he has not considered that &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; is still subjective. Although someone like Blithering Genius would argue in favor of maintaining the high-standard of living and mostly desirable material conditions of modernity (presumably in the interest of overall &ldquo;well-being&rdquo;?), someone else like an Efilist like Gary Inmendham would argue that the best &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; for all the sentient life on Earth at large would be if they all the sentient life was destroyed or euthanized and that the Earth was rendered uninhabitable for all future life.</li>
<li>Efilists would argue that the greatest well-being is the complete absence of suffering, no matter how much pleasure life may receive overall. And other people argue that the positive value of pleasure exceeds the negative value of pain, or that the total value of pleasure versus pain always adds up to zero. Sam Harris&rsquo;s argument in favor of objective morality still fails because &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; is subjective to interpretation.</li>
<li>And since Sam Harris is presumably against a hypothetical Benevolent World Explosion proposal, how would he decisively argue that it would be an objectively &ldquo;bad&rdquo; thing to do? How would he irrefutably argue that the existence of pleasure overrides or equals out the existence of pain? What makes his conception of &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; any better than the Efilist conception of &ldquo;well-being&rdquo;? If it&rsquo;s immoral to euthanize the entire Earth since some/most sentient organisms want to live, how is it not immoral for everyone to continue bringing children into this world if it&rsquo;s inevitable that at least some of them won&rsquo;t want to be alive at all?</li>
<li>In the book, Harris acknowledges that &ldquo;there could, in principle, be a species compared to which we are relatively unimportant (although he doubts such a species exists).&rdquo; (according to Wikipedia&rsquo;s article on the Moral Landscape). But if this were hypothetically true, then couldn&rsquo;t this have the potential to create a moral conflict that would demonstrate the relativity of morality? The humans would want to live, but the theoretically more important species could argue that they have a right to use the humans and their world as they wish because they are more important. The biological and Darwininan tendency is for the individual to always justify themself. The humans will justify their existence against the more important species (the hyper-intelligent aliens), and the aliens will justify themselves against the humans. There is no right moral answer here.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It still subjective to value a net increase in total happiness over a net decrease in total suffering. Assuming that positive (classical) utilitarianism is a self-evident criteria for judging objective morality completely disregards negative utilitarians who believe that any total reduction pain should be prioritized over any total increase in happiness.</li>
<li>Who&rsquo;s to say that positive utilitarianism is objectively better than negative utilitarianism? Some extreme negative utilitarians like the people on r/Efilism would argue that it would better to euthanize all the sentient life on Earth and render the Earth to be permanently uninhabital because even 8+ billion happy people could never justify even a single person who is suffering.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
Anybody who defines &ldquo;objective&rdquo; morality as maximizing well-being basically believes in some form of utilitarianism. The definition for Utilitarianism is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Utilitarianism is a family of normative ethical theories that prescribe actions that maximize happiness and well-being for all affected individuals.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, defining &ldquo;objective&rdquo; morality in terms of well-being does NOT work because well-being is subjective too. There are several different types of Utilitarianism, so it would be very arbitrary of you to label ONLY ONE form of Utilitarianism as the &ldquo;objective&rdquo; one, out of many different conceived versions.
The main reason why moral objectivists have a strong tendency to leans towards believing some kind of Utilitarian framework is that their false conception of objective morality forces them to find some sort of supposedly objective aggregation onto an absolute scale, and it is necessary for them to do this, which results in an insoluble problem.
Also, if it is truly the case that all pain and pleasure metaphysically balance out in reality, then such a fact would make Utilitarianism a very questionable basis for morality, much less an &ldquo;objective&rdquo; one.
</p></li>
<li>Defending the fundamental subjectivity of morality can NOT be debunked as a Subjectivist Fallacy. The real fallacy at play here is the insistence of the moral objectivists about applying an objective method for making decisions (reason) to a fundamentally subjective idea (values). Once again, there is no such thing as objective value, for the reasons that I&rsquo;ve already explained. The moral objectivists are making a fallacy because they aren&rsquo;t acknowledging the limitations of reason.</li>
<li>Nobody can ever do anything with a 100% guarantee that their actions will always be an unequivocally good thing. Examples:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ProtonMail and security services helping both innocent people who want privacy AND criminals at the same time.</li>
<li>The United States arming the Taliban to fight the Soviets during the Cold War, but later on the Taliban uses the same weapons to fight against the American invasion and occupation of Afghanistan.</li>
<li>Helping people develop good public speaking skills. They could use those skills for &ldquo;good&rdquo; things or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; things, and you can never know for sure. Hitler for example, probably had at least some practice and feedback developing good public speaking skills.</li>
<li>Ending world hunger, but then triggering a global overpopulation crisis.</li>
<li>Helping people become better programmers, but then they become hackers instead, or help China develop a national surveillance and social credit system that monitors everybody 24/7.</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>i</li>
</ul></li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-when-life-becomes-zero-sum">
<p>
Without cooperation, life becomes zero-sum when the population reaches the carrying capacity of the environment. If either of those conditions are not meant (not possible to cooperate with others, or population is below environment&rsquo;s carrying capacity), then life can be &ldquo;positive sum&rdquo;. The point in recognizing the conditions for life to be zero-sum is to show further evidence why morality is not objective. When life does become zero-sum, it&rsquo;s every man for himself.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For every prey that gets eaten alive, there is a predator who doesn&rsquo;t starve to death.</li>
<li>For every prey that escapes, there is a predator who ends up starving to death.</li>
<li>For every guy who misses a job opportunity, someone else will get it instead.</li>
<li>For every male that doesn&rsquo;t get to mate with the prized female, some other victorious male does.</li>
<li>For every slave, there is a slave owner who profits big time.</li>
<li>For every guy who lost money on the stock market, someone else gained money because for every buyer, there is a seller and vice versa.</li>
<li>For every guy who lost scarce, precious resources, someone else acquired those valuable resources and used them to survive another day, become more reproductively successful, and have more offspring than the loser.</li>
<li>And so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When there are winners who can only come at the expense of losers, it&rsquo;s in everyone&rsquo;s self-interest to be a winner rather than a loser. In such cases, people are <b>not</b> obligated to care about whether that causes someone else to incur negative consequences. Evolution is the game that runs literally everything, so that&rsquo;s the game everybody <b>has to</b> play, even if it comes at the cost of others.
</p>

<p>
Now, life doesn&rsquo;t always have to be a zero-sum game. When individuals cooperate with each other, they can both become better off if they manage to solve the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma between each other. Unfortunately, it isn&rsquo;t always guaranteed that the other side won&rsquo;t defect, and that&rsquo;s why cooperating is not an objectively good choice.

<h2 id="orgb3014b8"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why Cooperation Is Not Objectively Moral, Even If Would Produce The Greatest Amount Of Wealth</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Since Libertarians and Ancaps are strong proponents of contract theory ethics, they believe that it is unthinkable and wickedly immoral for anybody to break any contract or agreement that two or more parties agrees to. That being said, their moral dogmas prevent them from realizing that the omnipresent possibility that anybody could defect from an agreement is precisely why it isn&rsquo;t objectively correct that cooperation is always the best choice for the agents in the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma. Even if cooperation would lead to higher wealth and overall well-being for all the parties involved, cooperation is still <b>not</b> going to be the best option if it&rsquo;s possible that the other side could and/or would defect.
</p>

<p>
People who argue that cooperation is &ldquo;objectively moral&rdquo; don&rsquo;t understand the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma. In the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma, the choices are selfishness or altruism. There is no (viable) cooperation choice, because reciprocity is not ensured. That&rsquo;s why the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma has to be solved to create cooperation.
</p>

<p>
If cooperating together was the objectively best choice, i.e. it offers the greatest individual reward for each player and defection is guaranteed to not happen, then prisoner&rsquo;s dilemmas wouldn&rsquo;t exist at all in the first place. Conversely, if prisoner&rsquo;s dilemmas didn&rsquo;t exist, then there would be no inquiry as to why someone would choose anything less than the option with the greatest potential reward and what can be done to achieve that.

<h2 id="technology-creates-illusion"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Moral Progress Is Largely Caused Only By Technology</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-technology-creates-illusion">
<p>
&ldquo;Moral Progress&rdquo; is an illusion created by the advancement of technology. Without technology, we wouldn&rsquo;t have seen any improvements in material conditions for humans, and likewise there would never be any such collective illusion of moral progress among the public. At the same time, humans only started to care about moral progress when they stopped being focused on just merely surviving 24/7, something that has only been made possible by the advent of technology. A human who is focused on survival 24/7 would never have any time to think nor care about what&rsquo;s moral because they&rsquo;re only focused on what helps them survive, as well as what helps their community survive since the community aids the survival.
</p>

<p>
Given that the invention of technology made it possible for humans to not have to think about survival 24-7, this made it possible for humans to start thinking about morality because they now had extra time on their hands to think about how and why they should live their lives. Before then, it was impossible for humans to think about morality because they never had any time to think about it since they were necessarily concerned for survival and reproduction instead. If it was not possible for humans to think about morality before the advent of technology, then they cannot be faulted for doing things that most people today would consider to be immoral.
</p>

<p>
So to summarize, technology caused humans to start consciously thinking about morals beyond just human survival by giving humans more free time to focus on things not related to survival. Eventually, technology caused the growth and settlement of human populations which necessitated structured human societies that established law and order. Along with that and newer religions, the illusion of moral progress was further enhanced. In today&rsquo;s world, the illusion of moral progress is at its greatest and most pervasive extent ever because:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Technology has significantly improved material conditions in order to abandon things that violate ethical intuitions like slavery, monarchical rule, rape, et cetera,</li>
<li>Culture, mass education, and mass media have all reinforced the instillation of collective morality onto the public, and</li>
<li>The necessity for humans to engage in the power process, but the inability to do so by natural means in a technologically-advanced world compels people (leftists especially) to devote their time to prattling about social causes that they believe in to give them some sort of objective to strive towards (even though accomplishing this objective would subsequently force them to find something else to do in this world if there was no more virtue-signaling that could be done about anything).</li>
</ol>
<p>
So not only has technology made it possible for humans to think about morality beyond their own selfish desires for survival, but technology has also made both the illusions of moral progress and objective morality possible as well.
</p>

<p>
Of course, there have been thousands of prehistorical human religions, but without further knowledge about anthropology, it is difficult to say to what extent any of those religions directed any thought about moral progress, if any.
</p>

<p>
If determinism is true and humans don&rsquo;t truly have free will, then how could any real moral progress ever truly happen? Steven Pinker doesn&rsquo;t talk specifically or coherently about this disconnect between like the determinism that he supposedly believes and then just his assumption that moral progress is happening.
</p>

<p>
The closest thing there&rsquo;s ever been to moral progress has been the elimination of war, disease, and famine, followed by the subsequent recognition of individual rights during modernity. Since the illusion of moral progress has been driven by improvements in material conditions, this suggests that the &ldquo;best&rdquo; morality should be structured around the best practices that further strengthen the material conditions of humans. This thus makes a sound justification for adopting cooperationist ethics.

<li>In modern post-WWII times, war has been quite uncommon compared to its historical presence, but this has only been made possible due to the establishment of improved living conditions around the world (thus reducing the need to compete for resources worldwide), free trade (which reduces conflicts between nations), and the intense favorability to avoid the gruesome potential for destruction and nuclear war that has never been seen before.</li>
<li>Modern contraception and birth control made it possible to not have children born into undesirable conditions.</li>
<li>The automobile relieved the pressure on land values and land rent by making it possible for people to move out of the cities and into the suburbs, although this has only been a temporary fix since the core problem has yet to be resolved by universal LVT.</li>

People from all kinds of different ideologies want to colonize Mars not only because it gives them something to work towards as a means of fulfilling their needs for the power process, but also because they perceive Mars as a place of opportunity and free of foreign interference to set up whatever so-called utopia and utopian ideology that they believe in. Examples:

<li>The decline of European colonialism (it became too expensive to rule overseas colonies, and the local populations began protesting and fighting for independence). It should be noted however that European colonialism seems to have been mostly beneficial in most (but not all) cases since technologies caused declines in infant mortality rates, starvation, diseases, and other factors that have limited the local populations.</li>

<p>
Interestingly, anarcho-primitivists are some of the few people who would actually argue that the progression of technology has actually caused a significant regression in moral progress, whereas virtually everyone else enthusiastically views technology as a way to continue &ldquo;moral progress&rdquo;. Besides anarcho-primitivists, some of the most extreme communists and socialists might would believe that humanity has not made much if any moral progress since they hate capitalism so much, even though capitalism has been largely beneficial for humanity.

<h2 id="not-everybody-wants-tech-society"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Not Everybody Wants To Live In A Technologically-Advanced Society</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-everybody-wants-tech-society">
<p>
Contrary to popular belief, not everybody wants to live in a technologically-advanced society where everybody lives harmoniously with each other. Many people assume that everybody wants exactly this, and that this implies the existence of an objectively-correct morality, but there are some notably interesting ideologies that oppose it, so it would be a logical and philosophical mistake to assume that this is a universal moral premise that everybody has.
</p>

<p>
Anybody who assumes this has not thought enough about the philosophical nature of problems, how and why problems arise, nor have they questioned the best type of well-being (form of utilitarianism). Two such counter-examples ideologies that disagree with this popular and naive premise are Efilism and Anarcho-Primitivism.
</p>

<p>
Efilists disagree because they believe in absolute [negative-utilitarianism] that not even the existence of the smallest quantity of pain can ever be morally justified. Efilists recognize that wherever life exists, problems will never go away. Efilists thus believe that the most morally correct thing to do would be to eliminate all life so that problems will stop existing forever.
</p>

<p>
It is also naive to believe that technology is the solution to all problems. It is literally impossible for life to exist without problems, because once again, problems will never go away for as long as life continues to exist. That being said, Anarcho-Primitivists (Anprims) believe that technology causes more problems than it solves.
</p>

<p>
Both of these ideologies have their short fallings, but in some ways, these two ideologies are more enlightened than the conventional Humanist worldview of the West. There might even be more ideologies that oppose this premise than just the two counter-examples that I have mentioned here, but the bottom line is that since not everybody agrees that a harmonious, technologically-advanced society would be a utopia where maximal morality is achieved, the premise that everybody wants to achieve that cannot be assumed as a basis for objective morality.

<p>
It is a <b>huge</b> mistake to view morality as black and white. Even if morality was objective, there&rsquo;s far more ways to be wrong than there are ways to be right, so anybody who merely <b>thinks</b> that they are imposing supposedly objective morality is statistically most likely to be wrong. Many people would also use their belief that they are imposing the one and only true &ldquo;objective&rdquo; morality as a justification to rule with an iron fist.
