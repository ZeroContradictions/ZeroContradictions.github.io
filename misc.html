        <p>
            <img src="images/georgism-flag-1.jpg" alt="Zero Contradictions">
            Hello and welcome to my philosophy blog. My name is ZeroContradictions, and on this home page you will find links to my philosophical writings <font color="red">(highlighted in red)</font>, as well as links to posts from blogs written by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy <font color="blue">(highlighted in blue)</font>, and links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <font color="green">(highlighted in green)</font>. As per its name, the goal of this blog is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that. The Modern World has reached an unprecedented level of insanity due to immense evolutionary mismatch caused by the Industrial Revolution and incoherent moral values, and it is now more important than ever to get the philosophical grounding necessary for solving the problems set before us.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: As of November 2022, the vast majority of the red link posts written by myself are unfinished, and have sections that need further elaboration and/or updating with my current beliefs, but I'm publishing what I have already written for now for others to read if they'd like. If you have any constructive criticism on this blog's HTML/CSS design (it's my first time designing a website), please reach out to me at <a class="ZC-essays" href="meta/contact.html">my contact page</a>. I will probably have to learn how to write some YAML code and better CSS in order to optimize this blog's design.

        <p>I explain the effects that a Universal Auxiliary Language would have on the world, why it's a better solution to language barriers than building universal translator devices, the practicality of undertaking the establishment of such a phenomenon, and what would be needed to make it happen.</p></li>

        <p>Logographic writings draw their advantages from linking meanings to writing, rather than sounds to writing, as a phonetic writing system would. From a linguist's perspective, they both have their strengths, and neither is better than the other.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="language/heisigs-method.html">The Best Way to Learn Logographic Writing Systems: Heisig's Method</a>
        <p>Heisig's Method is the best way to learn Hanzi and Kanji since it separating the learning process into two phases: memorizing the characters and themselves and their semantics, and learning how to pronounce the characters and their various connotations. I explain why this is the superior and most efficient approach.</p></li>

        <p>She messed up almost everything, except for rationalism and egoism. She was wrong about her poorly chosen axioms, materialism, free will, the true nature of value and morality, she didn't apply anything evolutionary or biological reasoning, she didn't understand the purpose of government, and she made several glaring logical errors.</p></li>

        <p>Background of this website, why I'm critiquing it, how it influenced my life by causing me to start deeply thinking about philosophy at 19 years old, and how my philosophy has changed over the years.</p></li>

        <p>In summary, Efilism relies on four assumptions: hedonism, altruism, assymetry of pain and pleasure, and life is violent.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="journey/case-against-efilism.html">The Case Against Efilism: Why Efilism Will Never Win</a>
        <p>I used to be a borderline Efilist, even though it went against my natural desires and intuitions. This essay explains why I fully rejected Efilism.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="journey/transhumanism-vs-anprimism.html">Transhumanism vs Anarcho-Primitivism</a>
        <p>I give my two cents on Transhumanism and Anarcho-Primitivism, and why neither of them can solve the problems of Modernity. I then present what I think would be a better alternative to both of them.</p></li>

        <p>Adam Lanza's secret Youtube channel revealed his intentions. His personal philosophy (Euvalism, value spelled backwards) had similarities to Efilism, Antinatalism, and Anarcho-Primitivism, but it was also uniquely different, and emphasized a hatred for culture. Eventually he chose to free himself from having values via his own death.</p></li>
