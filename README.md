<!--
**ZeroContradictions/ZeroContradictions.github.io** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hello and welcome to my philosophy blog. My name is Zero Contradictions, and on this home page you will find links to my philosophical writings (highlighted in red), as well as links to posts from blogs written by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy (highlighted in blue), and links to videos / channels (highlighted in green). As per its name, the goal of this blog is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that.

NOTE: As of November 2022, the vast majority of the red link posts written by myself are only half-finished and incomplete. It would take me dozens, maybe hundreds of hours to finish all the writing and copy-editing for all my posts, but I'm publishing what I already have written for now. You can read what I've written now if you'd like, but be aware that some of the content displayed here was written a few years ago and is out-of-date with my current beliefs, and most of it is unfinished and/or needs elaborations. There also may be a few things here and there that are not formatted correctly since I have yet to edit the markup language used around any unformatted text.

If you have any constructive criticism on this blog's HTML/CSS design (it's my first time designing a website), please reach out to me at my contact page. I will probably have to learn how to write some PHP code in order to optimize this blog's design.
