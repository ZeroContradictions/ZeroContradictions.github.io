Reform Objectives For Saving The Future Of Scientific Technological Western Civilization, If It Is To Last Another 50 Years

If I can only do a handful things to improve the structure of the government, in order of importance, the reforms would be:
1. Gradual Transition to Location Value Taxes, plus immediate implemenation of taxes on collective rents: natural resources, pollution taxes, severance taxes, etc.
2. Requiring Procreation Licenses in order to reproduce and have children.
3. Implementation of Singapoure's Approach to Government Programs and Welfare, with the addition of Laborer's Bonus Income
4. Parliamentary Democracy, with Citizen's Veto and other features that would enhance the efficiency and outcomes of Democracy
5. Immigration Restrictions
7. Legalization of illegal drugs, substances, and prostitution to end the drug war and victimless crimes.
8. Privatization of Social Security, end of government-backed college subsidies and student loans, and end of welfare state.
9. Formation of a Global Government

Everything else that needs to be fixed would be cultural factors, and those would have to be fixed by changing the ideologies, memes, and media that flow around in the culture.
