<h3 id="org048c1e6"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> The Practicality of Constitutions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The de facto power of the United States Constitution is weaker than the de jure power of the Constitution, but this isn&rsquo;t really surprising. At the end of the day, a Constitution is just a piece of paper created by the government to limit what the government can do. So if the government had the power to create the constitution and enforce it, then it can just as easily have the power to stop enforcing parts of it or even ignore it completely.
</p>

<p>
But if government is going to exist, it definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be unreasonable to have a document of rules describing what the government must aim to do, as well as what it can and cannot do. Even most anarchists have implicit rules for their societies, and they would have to have a document that explicitly states the rules of their &ldquo;societies&rdquo; if they were actually serious about their ideas. That said, it&rsquo;s still worth creating a Constitution that states the explicit rules of society and figuring out the best characteristics that a Constitution should have.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: In order for a Constitution to have the true power and enforcement that its authors intended it to have, Constitutions must be enforced <b>directly</b> by the people instead of the government. It cannot be stressed enough that the citizens much be vigilant to veto, rebel, and reform if the legal system ever proposes an anti-constitutional update to the legal code, lest <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-deep-state-and-myth-of-democracy.html?view=classic">a deep state will form</a>. However, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how such a society could be structured to make this more likely or even guaranteed to happen, if it&rsquo;s even possible.

<h3 id="org62dc7e9"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> The Goals Of The Government</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
The first and foremost goal of government is to resolve Prisoner Dilemmas and Tragedies of the Commons. Government comes from the necessity to create a reasonable set of laws that would create a societal framework from which selfish individuals can cooperate together for greater mutual gain (than if they didn&rsquo;t cooperate together). Cooperation is the foundation of civilization, and the best legal code is the one that enables that to the greatest extent possible.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Any proposal must be geopolitically stable. A network of city states would fail since it wouldn&rsquo;t be geopolitically stable, so it is not viable.
</p>

<p>
There are lots of ideas that would not be geopolitically stable, and yet people think they&rsquo;re immoral anyway.
    I couldn&rsquo;t care less if people think that measures that ensure geopolitical stability are &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; (e.g. the selective service system, not allowing secession, maintaining a strong global military presence, etc).
    If the alternative is geopolitically instability, then those moralistic ideas are not worth any consideration because they would enable war, conflict, and the country&rsquo;s downfall.()
</p>

<p>
Private cities are similar in concept to the nation-states that exist today, except that nation-states are bigger, authoritarian by default, and are characterized by local geography, socio-ethnolinguistic groups, history, cultures, etc. If one doesn&rsquo;t like the country that they are currently living in, they (usually) have a choice to leave and migrate to another.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
From Industrial Society And Its Future by Dr. Ted Kaczynski:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Paragraph #187: On the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself to people who are intelligent, thoughtful and rational. The object should be to create a core of people who will be opposed to the industrial system on a rational, thought-out basis, with full appreciation of the problems and ambiguities involved, and of the price that has to be paid for getting rid of the system. It is particularly important to attract people of this type, as they are capable people and will be instrumental in influencing others. These people should be addressed on as rational a level as possible. Facts should never intentionally be distorted and intemperate language should be avoided. This does not mean that no appeal can be made to the emotions, but in making such appeal care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth or doing anything else that would destroy the intellectual respectability of the ideology.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph #188: On a second level, the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form that will enable the unthinking majority to see the conflict of technology vs. nature in unambiguous terms. But even on this second level the ideology should not be expressed in language that is so cheap, intemperate or irrational that it alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type. Cheap, intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves impressive short-term gains, but it will be more advantageous in the long run to keep the loyalty of a small number of intelligently committed people than to arouse the passions of an unthinking, fickle mob who will change their attitude as soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick. However, propaganda of the rabble-rousing type may be necessary when the system is nearing the point of collapse and there is a final struggle between rival ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old world-view goes under.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<p>
One Proposal for Preventing Gerrymandering in a Democratic Republic: Remove party affiliations at the time of voter registration. Do not track home addresses on ballots. Voter ID is done through the driver’s license authenticity, but does not require you to retain the information together. Now politicians don’t know where you live and can’t draw districts with biases.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When many liberal democracies offer voters yes/no propositions to vote for on a city, state, or national level, this is rather similar to the 2/3 direct democratic veto that I am proposing as a check on the reason system.</li>
<li>Among eligible participating voters, if for every person who does not disapprove of the legislation, there are two people who disapprove, then the legislation is vetoed. Although a skeptic might argue that percentages are arbitrary, two-thirds (or approximately 66.66%) is the lowest majority ratio that is higher than 50% (or half of the population) AND only uses integers.</li>
<li>Maybe it could even be a two to one ratio among eligible voters, regardless of whether everybody voted or not? Would this be practical at all?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Other integer ratios include three-fourths, four-fifths, five-sixths, etc. Maybe if a high enough ratio is reached, the members of the reason system decision council must be purged and re-elected?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hopefully the system for direct democratic vetoes against the reason/legal system would not devolve to have people joining political organizations akin to the political parties that exist today. Vetoing is a yes/no process, so the nature of the process could prevent such political organizations from forming for collectively vetoing or not vetoing legislation.</li>

<p>
For every <i>x</i> number of pages that a legislation document has and every <i>y</i> number of pages that added amendments have, there should be a minimum of <i>d</i> number of days between when it was proposed and when it is passed.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The purpose of this regulation is to guarantee that the members of the reason system have enough time to read the legislation and carefully evaluate it before making a decision on it.

<li>If this rule is always enforced without exception, the worst case scenario would be that the members of the reason system simply don&rsquo;t read the legislation like they&rsquo;re supposed to.</li>

<h3 id="orge6ac77d"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> Why Corporal Punishment And Humiliation Are More Practical Punishments Than Making Prisoners Spend Years In Prison</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to punish taxpayers by forcing them to pay money that is used to imprison people who broke the law. Why should a person who is lazy and committed crimes have their existence funded by good laboring people who are actually contributing to society? A better method of punish the lawbreakers without wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I propose that corporal punishment should be used instead of prison sentences. This way, lawbreakers are punished, and taxpayers don&rsquo;t have to pay the price for keeping the lawbreakers locked up in prison. Physical punishment works in Singapore, and Singapore has some of the lowest per capita crime rates in the world (although race and economic factors undoubtedly help with this too). The people who get punished may be unable to work for a few days while they heal from the injury and are experiencing the pain, but then they have to go back to work, and taxpayers won&rsquo;t have to subsidize their existence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">People cannot imagine what it&rsquo;s like to spend 5 years in prison.</span> Especially if it&rsquo;s often far longer than that, it completely ruins someone&rsquo;s life. People cannot intuitively understand how bad that is. And once the prisoners finally leave the prison, how are they supposed to get back into the real world and return to a normal lifestyle? They could go back to the outside world, but it would be completely alien to them because everybody would be changed and different. Imprisoning someone for several years is a detriment to everybody in society, including hardworking taxpayers who have to pay for the imprisonment. Some wouldn&rsquo;t even want to go back out into the real world because they&rsquo;ve become so familiar with the prison world, hence why people often get re-incarcerated immediately after they leave prison.
</p>

<p>
Another big factor that could change or possibly improve the effects of physical punishment could be to have it be done publicly. Being caned in the townsquare for everybody to see the person deserving the punishment would be a way to humiliate them, so instead of being a purely psychological force for discouraging/preventing crime, it could also be turned into a social force, possibly even a eugenic force if we consider the following scenario. If someone is seen by the public being punished, then fewer people would work with them, and thus they would make less money, and thus they would have fewer children.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Physical punishment also invokes primal instincts,</span> which could very strongly increase its effectiveness and people&rsquo;s willingness to avoid it as much as possible. If the brain can be roughly divided into about three parts, then the fear of corporal punishment and strong desire to avoid it works off the most basic structures within the human brain. Both of these proposed punishments are based on incentives, and utilize both psychological and economic principles. Being soft on crime causes crime. And making people spend several years in prison when it&rsquo;s a very costly and ineffective punishment counts as being soft on crime.
</p>

<p>
Or alternatively, a prisoner could be offered assisted suicide. Then the taxpayers don&rsquo;t have to subsidize their existence, and the prisoner then has no further opportunities to pass their genes onto the next generation. In most cases, it would just be better for everybody if people serving multiple life sentences in prison were just sentenced to death instead, but the main reason why this doesn&rsquo;t happen is due to people&rsquo;s moral dogmas.

As concluded by the videos above, a portion of the government revenue would be set aside to provide monetary awards and official recognition to anybody who manages to create a major innovation and document it.
</p>

<p>
The branch of government that is responsible for describing problems to be solved for monetary rewards and distributing the rewards to the winners would also provide rewards for people who solve major mathematical and/or scientific problems. Currently, for many unsolved mathematical problems, there are no monetary rewards for completing them, but providing rewards could incentivize more people to attempt completing them.

<p>
There will be a public education system and a voucher system, similar to health insurance in the United States, where healthcare is provided by private companies, but there is a public safety net for everybody else. Parents who don&rsquo;t want to enroll their children into the public education system would not have to pay taxes to fund it, and would only have to pay for their children&rsquo;s private education expenses.
</p>

<p>
This free-market approach would provide private education companies with equal opportunity, but also
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s a good argument for a government-provided safety net for education. Public education can have a unifying effect on the collective values of society, which helps reduce the variance of the society&rsquo;s values.
In a society, you want to distribute the risks of life among everybody, and that&rsquo;s why safety nets on a collective level are a good idea.
