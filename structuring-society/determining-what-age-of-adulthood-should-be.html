<h2 id="org70dbf99"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Reasons Why 16-Year-Olds Should Be Considered Legal Adults</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A human being is socially considered to be an adult at 16 years old. The reasons for this are:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At 16, most women and some men have completed puberty (most men complete puberty at 17 years old).</li>
<li>At 16 years of age, humans will have decent reasoning skills to make their own decisions for themselves.</li>
<li>If people become adults and complete their secondary education at 16 years old instead, then that gives them 2 additional years to live their lives the way they want to.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Even after 13 years of compulsory education, most people still don&rsquo;t everything that they need to know because the state sucks at teaching rational thinking. If better education provided by the free market was available, people could probably learn the same stuff in 11 years instead, by the time they become 16 years old.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If people remain under legal guardianship for another two years after 16 years old and it simply isn&rsquo;t a good situation/environment for them, then they can leave that mediocre / suboptimal situation 2 years earlier by becoming a legal adult.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Humans have no control to determine who the parents/guardians that will raise them are, so if they have bad / mediocre guardians, then they should be free to leave them ASAP.</li>
<li>But if they do like who they&rsquo;re living with, then they can stay with them because nothing is stopping them. On the other hand, requiring minors to live with their parents after an unnecessary age can oppress them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If people are told that they are adults and that they are responsible for their own actions, then there is some psychology to make them believe that they are adults and act like adults.</li>
<li>It is known that the average human doesn&rsquo;t completely finish their brain development until 25 years of age. Although 25 year olds would probably be able to make better decisions than their 16-year-old past-selves, brain development should not be used as a metric to determine adulthood. The ability to make rational decisions regarding one&rsquo;s life should be the metric, and people would make more rational decisions if they were given better, more fulfilling educations that taught philosophy and critical thinking skills and finished teaching by 16 years of age.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Furthermore, people don&rsquo;t need to be 25 years old to make important life decisions. I&rsquo;m sure a 16-year-old wouldn&rsquo;t either (assuming that they are rational and were given a comprehensive education). If they&rsquo;re old enough to complete their education, complete puberty, get a job, date people, and drive, then they will be fine on their own.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The reasons why 18 years of age is the world&rsquo;s social standard for defining adulthood are mainly:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1) nearly all humans have finished puberty at this age. -If nearly all men finish puberty at 17 and nearly all women at 16 years old, then how about 17 years instead?</li>
<li>2) most people complete their 13 years of compulsory statist education by 18 years of age.</li>
<li>3) it is the predominant legal standard that almost every state uses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&ldquo;Sorry 16 through 24-year-olds, you guys aren&rsquo;t old enough to leave your mediocre parents, have maximum freedom, and make your own decisions.&rdquo; -This is kind of a strawman, but I felt like writing it anyway. I&rsquo;m not terribly impressed by my parents, and I think I probably would have been better off if I left them earlier.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
People should be considered adults at 16 years old instead of 18 years old. If a 16-year old can get a job, drive, manage finances, complete puberty, date people, and finish high school (under a free-market education system), then they should be granted the same liberties that an 18-year-old has.
</p>

<p>
Children are a lifelong commitment and investment, not something to be disregarded after 18 years.

<div id="outline-container-org76076f8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org76076f8"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Age Of The Majority</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In particular, younger cohorts&rsquo; attainment of adulthood centers on three criteria: gaining a sense of responsibility, independent decision-making, and financial independence.</li>
<li>The age of majority ranges internationally from ages 15 to 21, with 18 being the most common age. Why was the legal adult age historically 21 years old instead?</li>
<li>One can distinguish the legality of acts of a young person, or of enabling a young person to carry out that act, by selling, renting out, showing, permitting entrance, allowing participation, etc.</li>
<li>There may be distinction between commercially and socially enabling.</li>
<li>Sometimes there is the requirement of supervision by a legal guardian, or just by an adult.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sometimes there is no requirement, but rather a recommendation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Admission of a young person to a place may be restricted due to:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>concern of danger for that person,</li>
<li>concern that the place may lead the person to immoral behavior,</li>
<li>the risk that the young person causes damage (for example, at an exhibition of fragile items).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Regarding deciding the best age for adulthood, reaching adulthood implies:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Having all the freedoms of an adult.</li>
<li>The individual&rsquo;s parents no longer have a legal obligation to provide for them.</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
<li>An interesting observation about this is that if one has all the freedoms of an adult, but their parents still have to provide for them, it can create a conflict if they are still living in their parents&rsquo; home under their parents&rsquo; rules.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org89965c8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org89965c8"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Use An Age Range Instead Of A Flat Age</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Or maybe the system could be set up so that 16 years old and 17 years old can choose to become adults if they have completed their secondary education (among other requirements) if they want to. And then everybody else who met the requirements but chosen not to become an adult, or everybody who had not completed secondary education by 18 years old automatically becomes an adult at 18 yeasr old.</li>
<li>People start to do actions associated with adulthood at different ages, so this suggests that it would be more appropriate to use an age range instead of a flat age.</li>
<li>Maybe the concept of adulthood is a social construction instead of a biological one, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can be determined through. Social constructs aren&rsquo;t necessarily subjective since they can be determined with reason.</li>
<li>Even if 16 years old is determined to be the age for adulthood, this age is determined primarily by mental milestones. On the other hand, the basic qualifications for working for the military depend more on physical milestones instead of mental ones. Thus, it would probably make sense to set a minimum age of 17 or 18 years for this instead.</li>
