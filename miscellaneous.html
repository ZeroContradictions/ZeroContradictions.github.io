            <img src="images/georgism-flag-1.jpg" alt="Zero Contradictions">
            Hello and welcome to my philosophy blog. My name is ZeroContradictions, and on this home page you will find links to my philosophical writings <font color="red">(highlighted in red)</font>, as well as links to posts from blogs written by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy <font color="blue">(highlighted in blue)</font>, and links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <font color="green">(highlighted in green)</font>. As per its name, the goal of this blog is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: As of November 2022, the vast majority of the red link posts written by myself are unfinished, and have sections that need further elaboration and/or updating with my current beliefs, but I'm publishing what I have already written for now for others to read if they'd like. If you have any constructive criticism on this blog's HTML/CSS design (it's my first time designing a website), please reach out to me at <a class="my-essays" href="footer/contact-page.html">my contact page</a>. I will probably have to learn how to write some PHP code in order to optimize this blog's design.

<h2>Philosophy of Language / Linguistics</h2>

    <li><p>I have a Linguistics BA, hence why I have a whole section dedicated to posts talking about language and linguistis.</p></li>

        <p>I explain the effects that a Universal Auxiliary Language would have on the world, why it's a better solution to language barriers than building universal translator devices, the practicality of undertaking the establishment of such a phenomenon, and what would be needed to make it happen.</p></li>

        <p>[I will post this once I fix my broken LaTeX compiler] This is the senior thesis I wrote for my Mathematics BS. Language phonology can be modeled using set theory, string theory, combinatoritcs, finite-state transducers, calculus-based statistics.</p></li>

        <p>Logographic writings draw their advantages from linking meanings to writing, rather than sounds to writing, as a phonetic writing system would. From a linguist's perspective, they both have their strengths, and neither is better than the other.</p></li>
    <li><a class="my-essays" href="language/heisigs-method-for-learning-logographic-writing-systems.html">The Best Way to Learn Logographic Writing Systems: Heisig's Method</a>
        <p>Heisig's Method is the best way to learn Hanzi and Kanji since it separating the learning process into two phases: memorizing the characters and themselves and their semantics, and learning how to pronounce the characters and their various connotations. I explain why this is the superior and most efficient approach.</p></li>

        <p>She messed up almost everything, except for rationalism and egoism. She was wrong about her poorly chosen axioms, materialism, free will, the true nature of value and morality, she didn't apply anything evolutionary or biological reasoning, she didn't understand the purpose of government, and she made several glaring logical errors.</p></li>

        <p>Adam Lanza's secret Youtube channel revealed his intentions. His personal philosophy (Euvalism, value spelled backwards) had similarities to Efilism, Antinatalism, and Anarcho-Primitivism, but it was also uniquely different, and emphasized a hatred for culture. Eventually he chose to free himself from having values via his own death.</p></li>
